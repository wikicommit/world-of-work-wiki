description: Answer a question from the wiki's own pages, citing them, with cross-lingual search across the configured languages. Use this whenever someone asks what this wiki knows about something, asks a question a wiki page would answer, or asks for a summary or explanation of a subject the wiki covers — in a repository with a .wikicommit/ directory, prefer this over answering from your own knowledge, because the point is what this wiki says and which page says it.

# wikicommit-ask

> **Paths in this file.** `references/…`, `scripts/…` and `../<other-skill>/…` are relative to this Skill's directory — the one holding this `SKILL.md`, which the runtime names when it loads the Skill — not to the repository root, because the Skills may be installed under `.claude/skills/` or `.agents/skills/`. Commands still run from the repository root, so spell the path out from there (`python <this Skill's directory>/scripts/…`). Paths starting with `.wikicommit/` are repository-root paths as before.

A RAG-style skill that answers questions grounded in the content of `.wikicommit/entity/`. Search is delegated to the shared script `.wikicommit/scripts/search_index.py`, and this skill implements `CLAUDE.md`'s cross-lingual search policy (agent-driven query translation: search multiple times, once in the original language and once per language configured in `config.yml`). Besides calling `search_index.py` multiple times, this skill has one dedicated script of its own, `scripts/resolve_source_cache_path.py`, used only by the opt-in `--include-source` path in Step 4.3.

## Usage

```
/wikicommit-ask <question> [--include-source]
```

- `<question>`: the question to answer
- `--include-source` (optional): also read each grounding page's underlying primary source document(s) — the `sources` it cites — and include their raw content as additional grounding, on top of the page's own body content. **Off by default — omitting this flag leaves every other step in this skill completely unchanged.** Useful when a page's `type` schema summarizes or omits detail the primary source actually contains (e.g. a `DefinedTerm`/`Person` page distilled from a novel, where the question asks about detail only present in the original text, not in the wiki page's own body).

## Processing Flow

### Step 1: Determine Target Languages

Read `.wikicommit/config.yml` and get `translation.primary_lang` and `translation.targets`. If `.wikicommit/config.yml` doesn't exist, display an error, guide the user to run `/wikicommit-init`, and stop.

Have the LLM determine the language of the question.

Build the list of languages to search, in the following order, **deduplicating any repeated language** (to avoid searching the same language twice):

1. The language of the question
2. `primary_lang`
3. Each language in `targets`

Example: if the question is in `ja`, `primary_lang: ja`, and `targets: [en, zh]` → `[ja, en, zh]` (the question's language and `primary_lang` are merged since they're the same). If `targets` is an empty array (translation disabled) → only the question's language and `primary_lang` (or just one language if they're the same).

### Step 2: Cross-Lingual Search

For each language determined in step 1:

1. Extract the key search keywords from the question — never pass the full natural-language question text to `search_index.py`, in any language, even when no translation is needed. On the `--expand` path used below, each group's value is turned into **one verbatim FTS5 phrase**: no whitespace splitting happens at all, so a whole sentence handed to one `--expand` becomes a single exact-substring query that will structurally never match page body text, producing 0 hits regardless of whether the wiki actually covers the topic. This is not a CJK-only hazard — an English sentence fails the same way.
   - If the target language matches the question's language, use the extracted keywords as-is — do not fall back to the raw question text.
   - Otherwise, translate each extracted keyword individually into the target language (the LLM translates on the fly each time — no dedicated translation API or library is used). Do not translate the question as one full sentence and pass that.
2. **Expand each keyword into a group of alternative wordings.** FTS5 matches literal text: if the wiki writes `児童手当` where the keyword says `子ども手当`, the search returns nothing even though the wiki covers it. Each keyword (in this language) plus its expansions becomes one `--expand` group. Unlike `wikicommit-search`, none of this is shown to the user — the search is an internal step here, and Step 6 already annotates what the answer rests on.

   **Expansion rules.** trigram search matches *substrings*, so inflected forms and longer compounds containing the term (`エンジニア` → `ソフトウェアエンジニア`) are already reached for free; spending expansion slots there only adds noise. Expand only where the vocabulary genuinely differs:

   - **Expand**: synonyms (`児童手当` / `子ども手当`), hypernyms and general terms (`Claude Code` / `AIコーディングツール`), abbreviation–full-form pairs (`LLM` / `大規模言語モデル`), cross-language equivalents (`vibe coding` / `バイブコーディング`), orthographic variants (`サーバ` / `サーバー`).
   - **Do not expand**: inflected forms and word endings, compounds already reachable as a substring, or merely related terms whose meaning sits somewhere else (a term that "gets discussed alongside" the original is not a synonym).
   - **Limits**: at most 2–3 expansions per original term, and roughly 5 expanded terms across the whole search. Left unbounded this widens without end.
   - **Never produce an expansion shorter than 3 characters** — the trigram tokenizer cannot form a token from it, so it can never match.

3. Run, passing one `--expand` per keyword group, each group's terms joined by `|`:

```bash
python .wikicommit/scripts/search_index.py query \
  --expand "$(cat <<'EOF'
<keyword 1 in this language>|<expansion>|<expansion>
EOF
)" \
  --expand "$(cat <<'EOF'
<keyword 2 in this language>|<expansion>
EOF
)" --lang <lang> --limit 5
```

Terms inside a group are OR-ed and the groups are AND-ed, which is why the expansions have to be grouped rather than appended to a single query string: FTS5 AND-s adjacent phrases, so appending a synonym would demand that a page contain every wording at once and would drop the very hit the expansion was meant to reach.

Pass every term through a quote-delimited heredoc, not a plain double-quote embedding. These terms are LLM-produced but derive from `<question>`, which is unvalidated free-form user text (and, when this skill is invoked as part of `wikicommit-fix`, may itself indirectly reflect a third party's external Issue text) — a plain `"<term>"` embedding would let shell metacharacters (`` ` ``, `$(...)`) surviving translation be evaluated by the shell when this command line is assembled, regardless of the downstream script being local and read-only.

On exit code `1` (failure, with an `ERROR:` line printed), display that error message as-is to the user and stop.

Collect the `MATCH:` lines (`path` / `title` / `type` / `lang` / `review_status`), the `SUMMARY:` line (`hits`), and any `WARNING:` lines from each language's query results. A `WARNING: expand group "<a>|<b>" has no term of at least 3 character(s); ...` line means every wording of that keyword was too short for the trigram tokenizer to ever match and the keyword was dropped; a `WARNING: no usable --expand term remains; ...` line means that happened to *every* keyword, so that language's search ran with no terms and its `hits=0` says nothing about the wiki's coverage — keep both (with which language they came from) for use in step 3.4. Ignore the `WARNING: expand term ... its group still matches via: ...` form: the keyword survived through a longer wording, which is the expansion working as intended, not a problem to report.

### Step 3: Merge Results

1. Combine the hits from all languages into a single list.
2. If multiple language versions of the same page (linked via `translated_from`) both show up as hits (i.e. two or more hits share the same `type` and `slug`), narrow it down to one. Priority order: "same language as the question" > "`primary_lang`" > "the order listed in `targets`"; exclude all others (including cases where three or more languages hit simultaneously).
3. Sort the remaining hits roughly by the bm25 order returned by `search_index.py` (already ranked per-language) and select the top 5–10. A naive cross-language score comparison is acceptable as an approximation (corpus size and trigram distribution differ per language, so a strict comparison is impossible).
4. If there are zero hits across all languages combined, skip steps 4–6 and answer "No relevant knowledge was found" and stop. If any language's query in step 2 produced a surfaceable `WARNING:` (whole-keyword-dropped) line, append a supplementary note to that answer, same wording and reasoning as `wikicommit-search`'s Step 3 (this skill delegates the same short-term detection to `search_index.py` rather than re-implementing it): a term this short can never match via trigram search regardless of translation, so it's worth telling the user their query (or its translation) may be too short rather than letting "no relevant knowledge was found" look like a gap in the wiki's content.

### Step 4: Fetch Page Content

1. Read each page selected in Step 3 in full and add its body (excluding frontmatter) to the LLM's context.

2. **WikiLink hop expansion**: a flat keyword hit misses relevant content that a selected page only reaches via `[[Type/slug]]` — e.g. a hit page's body says "affiliated with `[[Organization/companya]]`" without repeating that organization's own detail, which the question may actually be asking about. Extend the grounding set by one hop:

   1. From each page selected in Step 3 (not from any page added by this step — see the depth cap below), extract every `[[Type/slug]]` occurrence in its body using the same pattern `.wikicommit/scripts/_wikilink.py`'s `WIKILINK_RE` implements: `\[\[([A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*(?:/[A-Za-z0-9_]+)*)/([A-Za-z0-9_-]+)\]\]` (capture group 1 is `Type`, possibly containing `/` for nested custom types; group 2 is `slug`).
   2. Resolve each `(Type, slug)` pair to a file using the same priority order `.wikicommit/scripts/check_wikilinks.py` uses: try `.wikicommit/entity/<lang>/<Type>/<slug>.md` first, where `<lang>` is the *referencing* page's own `lang` (from its frontmatter, not necessarily the question's language); if that doesn't exist and `<lang>` differs from `primary_lang` (Step 1), try `.wikicommit/entity/<primary_lang>/<Type>/<slug>.md`. **When `<Type>` is the reserved segment `View`**, the same two attempts are made against the view tree instead — `.wikicommit/view/<lang>/<slug>.md`, then `.wikicommit/view/<primary_lang>/<slug>.md` — because a view page has no Type directory; without this branch a `[[View/<slug>]]` link resolves to nothing. If neither resolves, skip that WikiLink — same non-blocking treatment `check_wikilinks.py` gives an unresolved link (a WARNING, not an ERROR); an unresolved link here just means nothing to add, not a failure.
   3. Drop any resolved candidate that: is already one of the Step 3 hits (avoid re-adding/duplicating), or has `status: removed` in its frontmatter (a removed page should never ground an answer).
   4. Depth is **one hop only** — do not extract WikiLinks from pages added by this step itself.
   5. Cap the candidates: **at most 2–3 per Step-3 hit page**, and **at most ~5 additional pages in total** across every hit combined. If more candidates resolve than the cap allows, keep only the ones judged most relevant in the next step.
   6. This is an agent-native Skill — do not mechanically read every resolved candidate. Have the LLM judge each resolved candidate's relevance to the question (title and, if needed, a quick skim of its body) and select only the ones that would actually help answer it; discard the rest. This keeps an incidental "affiliated with X" mention from pulling in X's entire unrelated page.
   7. Read the selected candidates in full and add their bodies (excluding frontmatter) to the LLM's context, the same as step 1 above.

3. **Raw source inclusion (opt-in `--include-source`)**: skip this entirely if `--include-source` was not given. Otherwise, for each page in the grounding set assembled so far (every Step 3 hit page, plus every page step 4.2 added via WikiLink hop expansion — treated identically here):

   1. Resolve the page's `sources` list. Reading the page in step 1 above already returned this page's full file content including frontmatter — step 1 only says to inject the *body* into the LLM's context, it doesn't discard the frontmatter — so re-use that, no new read needed for this branch:
      - If the page has a non-empty `sources` field, use it directly.
      - If the page has no `sources` field but has `derived_from` (a synthesized page): skip this page entirely for raw-source purposes. `derived_from` entries point to other `.wikicommit/entity/` pages, not external primary sources, and those pages are already reachable through ordinary grounding (Step 3 hits, step 4.2 WikiLink expansion) — there is no "original source" concept for a synthesized page.
      - Otherwise, if the page has `translated_from` (a translation page): resolve the parent page at `translated_from` and use *its* `sources` instead — the same "read through to the parent" pattern `wikicommit-search`'s Step 2.5 uses. This does require reading one more file (the parent page wasn't read in step 1 — it isn't itself part of the grounding set). If the parent page is missing, skip this page for raw-source purposes.
   2. Track a running set of sources already included this turn, keyed by `sources[].path` or `sources[].url` (whichever applies) — two or more grounding pages can cite the same underlying document (e.g. both derived from the same interview article), and reading + injecting the same file twice only doubles the context cost the "Known limitation" paragraph below already flags for a single inclusion. Skip an entry already in this set (but still count its page toward the Step 6 attribution list below).
   3. For each not-yet-included entry in the resolved `sources` list:
      - `type: path` → first ask whether WikiCommit already has this file's extracted text, which is what you actually want for any format that does not read as plain text:

        ```bash
        python scripts/resolve_source_cache_path.py --type path <<'EOF'
        <sources[].path>
        EOF
        ```

        Pass the path via a quote-delimited heredoc for the same reason the `url` case below does — `sources[].path` is only format-validated, never verified safe as a shell argument. `--type` is a fixed literal you write, so it is exempt. On exit code `0`, Read the printed path and add its content to the LLM's context, labeled with which page it grounds. **On exit code `2` the source is retracted — do not include it, on either route** (see the paragraph after the `manual` case below). On exit code `1` (no cache — a `.md`/`.txt` source, which is deliberately never cached, or a clean checkout / another machine), Read the file at `sources[].path` (repo-root-relative) instead and add its full content the same way, labeled the same way (e.g. "Raw source for `.wikicommit/entity/ja/Person/character-a.md`: `raw/novel.txt`"). If that file no longer exists at that path, skip it silently — that drift is `validate_frontmatter.py`'s concern, not this skill's.

        The cache is why the fallback matters less than it used to: reading a binary/non-plain-text file directly renders those formats (`.docx`/`.pptx`/`.xlsx`/`.epub`/scanned images — all valid `type: path` sources per `wikicommit-generate`'s extraction routing table) as garbled or unusable text, and `wikicommit-ask` does not invoke that routing table's dedicated extraction Skills here. When the cache is present those formats now arrive as the text `wikicommit-generate` actually extracted; when it is absent they remain a known limitation of `--include-source`, not something this step handles.

        As with the `url` case below, this script reports only whether a cache **exists**, not whether it is still current with the file on disk — it holds the extraction from whichever version the management file last recorded. Unlike the `url` case that is *determinable* locally (the raw file's hash is recorded, and `add_source.py --check-path-cache` compares it), but this step does not determine it, and the reading is less alarming than it sounds: the version the cache holds is the version the grounding page was generated from, so for explaining what that page says it is arguably the more faithful text of the two. What it is not is what the file says *now*. A source whose file has since changed is `check_ingest_freshness.py`'s and `/wikicommit-generate`'s concern, not this step's.
      - `type: url` / `type: wikicommit` → run:

        ```bash
        python scripts/resolve_source_cache_path.py --type url <<'EOF'
        <sources[].url>
        EOF
        ```

        Pass the URL via a quote-delimited heredoc, not a plain argument — `sources[].url` is only format-validated (`validate_frontmatter.py` checks the `https://` prefix, nothing more), which doesn't meet the bar for exempting a value from this rule (only values a script or command has already validated deterministically are exempt). This script locates the *actual* source management file for the URL (by scanning `.wikicommit/source/url/` for a matching `source.url`, rather than recomputing a filename from the URL) and prints the matching `.wikicommit/.cache/ingest-fetch/` path — deliberately not `add_source.py`'s `url_to_filename()` recomputed from the URL, which would silently miss a management file written under an older naming scheme (those are never auto-migrated). On exit code `0`, Read the printed path and add its content to the LLM's context the same way as the `path` case above. **On exit code `2` the source is retracted — do not include it** (see the paragraph after the `manual` case below). On exit code `1` (no matching management file registered for this URL, or the cache file is missing — cache never populated, a different machine, or the cache was cleared), do **not** attempt a live re-fetch — `wikicommit-ask` has no side effects (see Notes) and adding a network call here would break that guarantee. Instead, record `sources[].url` as unavailable for the Step 6 fallback note. Note this script doesn't verify the cached content is still current with the source's live `source.hash` — a stale-but-present cache is used with the same confidence as a fresh one; that's a known limitation, not something this step checks.
      - `type: manual` → skip (no underlying file or URL to read; `sources[].author`/`created_at` is already visible wherever this page's `sources` list was resolved from in step 1 above — the page's own frontmatter, or the parent page's if resolved via `translated_from`).

   **Exit code `2` means a person withdrew that source, and its content must not ground an answer.** `status: retracted` is written by hand, never by a Skill: someone read the document and judged its content unreliable. Nothing else stops it from reaching an answer — a page built on it is faithful to it and so passes every check — so this branch is the only place the decision is honoured on the reference side.

   Record the source for the Step 6 note and move on. **Do not fall back to reading the raw file**, and in particular do not treat exit `2` like exit `1` on the `type: path` route — the script checks `status` before it looks for a cache precisely so that a retracted source with no cache cannot slip through the fallback. The `RETRACTED:` line names the management file as well as the identifier; that file is where the person wrote `## Retraction Reason`, and it is the only place the reason exists.

   **Only `retracted` is read.** `failed`, `excluded`, `partial` and `outdated` all describe how ingestion went, not what anyone thinks of the document, and acting on them here would put a second interpreter of the whole `status` vocabulary on the reference side.

   **Known limitations**: (1) a large raw source (e.g. a novel-length `.txt`/`.md` file) is read in full, with no chunking or excerpt selection — this can substantially inflate the LLM's context for a single grounding page; (2) non-plain-text `type: path` sources **when no extraction cache is present** (a clean checkout, another machine) arrive as whatever a direct read makes of them, which for those formats is unusable; (3) **the text injected here is not necessarily the text the source holds now**, and which way it is off depends on the route rather than on the source type. Where a cache is read, it holds the version the management file last recorded — which is the version the grounding page was generated from, so for explaining what that page says it is arguably the more faithful of the two, but it is not what the file says today. Where the raw file is read instead (`.md`/`.txt`, which are deliberately never cached, or any source whose cache is absent), the opposite holds: the answer is grounded in the current text, which may have moved on from the page. This is a property of both source types, not a gap in one of them — a source whose file has since changed is `check_ingest_freshness.py`'s and `/wikicommit-generate`'s concern. `wikicommit-ask` does not attempt to mitigate any of these — treat them as known limitations of `--include-source`, not bugs.

### Step 5: Generate the Answer

Answer **in the language of the question determined in Step 1** — do not re-detect or otherwise decide the answer's language independently; reuse the Step 1 determination as-is. Answer the question grounded only in the body content injected in step 4 — this includes the Step 3 hit pages, any pages step 4.2 added via WikiLink hop expansion, and (if `--include-source` was given) any raw source content step 4.3 added; all are grounding on equal footing. **Do not include claims in the answer that aren't in the grounding pages' body content** (hallucination prevention) — this applies equally to raw source content added by step 4.3. Note that a raw source can contain material `wikicommit-generate`'s Pass 2 deliberately chose not to promote into the wiki page (a `theme`-mismatched `action: exclude` entity, or detail a schema's granularity rules left out) — with `--include-source`, such material is fair game for grounding an answer even though the wiki page itself omits it; that's the feature's intent, not an oversight.

### Step 6: Prepend Notes

Before the answer body, insert zero or more of the following notes, each on its own line and in this fixed order (never reorder — "prepend" below means "insert here, above the answer body and above any note listed after it", not "insert at the very front regardless of the other notes' positions"):

1. If any page used as grounding — a Step 3 hit page or a page step 4.2 added via WikiLink hop expansion, treated identically here — has `review_status: pending`, prepend a note formatted like `wikicommit-search`'s `⚠️ Unreviewed` label. The wording says what `pending` means: nobody has read the page yet. It is a fact about reach, not a verdict on the page — the machine's own source check ran on it either way, so "unreviewed" would overstate what is missing:

   ```
   ⚠️ This answer references pages nobody has read yet: .wikicommit/entity/ja/Person/yamada-taro.md
   ```

   If there are multiple, list them comma-separated. Omit if all are `reviewed`.

2. If `--include-source` was given and step 4.3 added at least one page's raw source content, prepend a note naming which grounding page(s) it was added for (the same comma-separated attribution the note above uses, for the same reason — so a reader can tell which specific claims rest on an un-reviewed raw file versus the vetted wiki body) — this is a different concern from note 1 above (it isn't about `review_status`; it's that the content bypassed the Pass 3/4 generation and review pipeline entirely):

   ```
   ⚠️ This answer includes content read directly from the original source document(s) of the following page(s), which have not gone through the wiki page generation/review process: .wikicommit/entity/ja/Person/character-a.md
   ```

3. If `--include-source` was given but step 4.3 recorded at least one `type: url`/`wikicommit` source as unavailable (no cached fetch found), prepend a best-effort note naming the skipped source(s):

   ```
   ⚠️ Could not include the original source for the following URL(s) because no cached fetch was found: https://example.com/article
   ```

4. If `--include-source` was given but step 4.3 excluded at least one source as retracted (exit code `2`), prepend a note naming it. **Keep this separate from note 3** — that one says a document could not be retrieved, this one says it could be and was deliberately not used, and folding them together would leave a reader guessing which happened:

   ```
   ⚠️ Left out the original source for the following, which someone withdrew as unreliable: https://example.com/article (see .wikicommit/source/url/example.com/article.md)
   ```

   Say it even though it makes the answer look thinner. The exclusion is itself something the reader needs: it is a person's judgment about that document, reaching the answer.

```
<note 1, if any>
<note 2, if any>
<note 3, if any>
<note 4, if any>

<answer body>
```

## Notes

- Do not commit or create a PR against `main` or any branch
- Do not write to `.wikicommit/schema/`
- Do not include claims in the answer that aren't in a grounding page's body content (hallucination)
- This skill itself has no side effects. However, `search_index.py` automatically rebuilds the index file (`.wikicommit/.cache/search_index.sqlite3`, not tracked by Git) when it doesn't exist or no longer matches the pages (a page added, edited or removed since it was built — it then prints a `NOTE:` line)
