#
# Issue #282 decided init never edits README.md, because a README is usually already there
# with a structure of its own. That reason does not hold when there is no README at all, so
# init writes one then — and only then. What it writes is a fixed template with the
# repository name filled in: no LLM-written text, which is what lets it ride in the
# foundational commit (Issue #843). English only for now; more languages than ja/en are
# planned, so this does not switch on primary_lang.
#
# The published-site link cannot be written here: GitHub Pages is enabled, and its
# `html_url` learned, in SKILL.md step 3 — after this script has run. So a marker holds the
# place, and `--finish-readme` replaces it (or removes it) once step 3 knows. The marker is
# written only under --quartz-pages; without it no step 3 URL can exist, and a README must
# not be handed over with a marker left in it.
