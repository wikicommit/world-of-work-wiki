"""Emit a reduced, whole-wiki view for LLM survey work over .wikicommit/entity/.

Usage:
    python .wikicommit/scripts/build_survey_view.py [--lang <lang>|all] [--max-pages N] [--limit N]

`/wikicommit-synthesize` run with no `<topic>` has to find the topic itself, by
looking at the wiki as a whole (Issue #586). The wiki's full text does not fit
in one context, so this script reduces every page to the few lines that carry
its cross-cutting structure — title, type, tags, `properties.description`,
its `##` section headings, and the WikiLinks it makes — and adds the aggregate
rankings (hubs, tags, types) computed from the link graph.

Why headings and the link graph, and not only `properties.description`:
`description` is capped at two or three sentences by design (Issue #495), so a
pattern that only shows up in a page's body would be invisible in a
description-only digest. Section headings are the cheapest part of a body that
still names what it covers. The graph matters even more: "several Place pages
connect through one Person" is not a statement about any single page's text at
all — it exists only between pages, and only a view that sees all of them at
once can find it.

This is deliberately a script rather than prose in a SKILL.md: surveying the
wiki means walking every page, and partial coverage would silently undercut the
one thing the survey is for. What the script does not do is judge — picking
topics out of this digest is the LLM's job, and is non-deterministic by nature.

Exit code: always 0 (report-only; an unreadable page is a WARNING on stderr).
