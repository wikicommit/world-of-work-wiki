"""Build and query the shared FTS5 trigram search index for the wiki.

Used by both the wikicommit-search and wikicommit-ask Skills (scripts called
by more than one Skill live in .wikicommit/scripts/).

Usage:
    python .wikicommit/scripts/search_index.py build
    python .wikicommit/scripts/search_index.py query "<query>" [--lang <lang>] [--limit N]
    python .wikicommit/scripts/search_index.py query --expand "<a>|<b>" --expand "<c>" [--lang <lang>] [--limit N]

`query` checks the index against the pages first and rebuilds it when they
differ (a fingerprint of every page's path, mtime and size is stored in the
index), so pages added, edited or removed since the last build are searched.

Exit code: 0 = success (0 hits is still success), 1 = SQLite lacks the FTS5
trigram tokenizer, .wikicommit/entity/ does not exist, or the query arguments
are contradictory (both a positional query and --expand, or neither).
