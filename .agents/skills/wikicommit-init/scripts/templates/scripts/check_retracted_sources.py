"""Detect wiki pages still resting on a source a human has retracted (Issue #737).

`status: retracted` says a human read a registered source, judged its content
unreliable, and took it out of use. Doing that stops the source from being
ingested again — `add_source.py` returns `RETRACTED` instead of re-registering
it, and `check_ingest_freshness.py` never rewrites it back to `outdated` — but
it does nothing to the pages that were already written from it. Those pages
keep the source in their `sources[]`, unchanged and unremarked.

This script closes that gap by reporting, not by acting. Issue #737 settled
deliberately on "report and stop there", for two reasons:

- Resetting `review_status` to `pending` does not fit the rule Issue #724 laid
  down. That rule delegates "did the content actually change?" to a
  deterministic script and keeps a non-deterministic judgment out of deciding
  whether a human has to re-read a page. A retraction changes no content at
  all — it changes the standing of the evidence behind it — so the same
  machinery cannot express it.
- Even if a page were reset, `pending` says "read this again" and not "here is
  what is now unsupported". The tracking-Issue template does not ask about the
  soundness of a page's sources, which is where Issue #737 started.

Which of the existing routes to take is a human's call:

- `/wikicommit-generate --regenerate <page>` rebuilds from the sources that
  remain, dropping the retracted one and its entry in `sources[]` (Issue #744).
  This is the route that actually takes a retracted source out of a page's
  evidence base, and it needs at least one surviving source. Two counts differ
  here: Regeneration Mode excludes any page carrying a `type: manual` entry
  outright, while the remaining count below deliberately counts one as a
  surviving source, so a page whose only remainder is a human assertion is a
  `/wikicommit-fix` rather than a rebuild.
- `/wikicommit-fix` corrects the text by hand, for a page whose problem is
  narrower than a rebuild.
- `/wikicommit-remove` takes the page down, which is the answer when nothing is
  left holding it up.

This script's whole job is to give a human enough to choose between them: which
pages, resting on which retracted source, and how much else those pages have to
stand on — the last of which is why every finding carries a remaining count.

Both trees are scanned. A view page carries `derived_from` rather than
`sources[]`, so it can never match directly, but it is not therefore safe:
it is built out of entity pages, and one of those may be the page resting on
the retracted source. That indirection is out of scope here —
`check_derivation_freshness.py` is the script that follows `derived_from`. Its
coverage of this case is conditional, though, and saying so matters: that
script fires when a grounding page is actually *rewritten*, and a retraction
rewrites nothing. So it reaches the indirection only once a human has acted on
the retraction (a `--regenerate` changes the grounding page, and the view page
goes STALE); a grounding page still standing on a retracted source with nobody
having done anything is not something it can see. The reason to leave the case
alone is a different one: covering it would have `wikicommit-synthesize` read
each grounding page's `sources[]` and interpret `status`, putting a third
interpreter of that vocabulary on the reference side (Issue #553) for a
two-hop indirection whose direct half this script already names.

`--list` serves a second caller entirely (Issue #928). `/wikicommit-review` and
`/wikicommit-fix` both re-fetch a page's `sources[]` and read the documents —
the former to judge whether the page is faithful to them, the latter to ground
a fix. Neither goes through `resolve_source_cache_path.py`, so the guard Issue
#918 added there does not reach them, and a source a human withdrew was being
read as ground truth. `--list` prints the same table step 1 builds and stops;
the callers match their own `sources[]` against it, before fetching anything.

Matching in the caller rather than answering a lookup here is deliberate. It
keeps this script the shape every `check_*` has (walk, report, exit 0), and it
costs one subprocess call per run rather than one per source — the scan reads
all of `.wikicommit/source/` either way.

Usage:
    python .wikicommit/scripts/check_retracted_sources.py
    python .wikicommit/scripts/check_retracted_sources.py --list

Exit code: always 0 (informational, non-blocking) — in both modes. A retraction
existing is not an error, and `--list` deliberately does not signal one through
the exit code: that is `resolve_source_cache_path.py`'s job (exit 2), and it
can do it because it answers about a single identifier.
