// New logic (not present upstream). .wikicommit/entity/<lang>/<Type>/<slug>.md is
// mirrored 1:1 into content/<lang>/<Type>/<slug>.md (see scripts/convert_wikilinks.py),
// so every Explorer tree has a <lang> folder ("ja", "en", ...) wrapping every
// Type directory. Without this, a reader has to expand that <lang> folder
// before any Type directory (Person, Organization, ...) becomes visible at
// all (Issue #209). WikiCommitLanguageSwitcher (a sibling component) already
// handles switching between languages, so Explorer's job here is narrower:
// only fold away the <lang> segment that matches the page currently being
// viewed, promoting its children up to root. Sibling-language folders (e.g.
// "en" while viewing a "ja" page) are left nested exactly as before, so they
// stay reachable by expanding them like any other folder.
//
// This only reorders where nodes sit in the tree — it does not touch
// node.slug (still includes the <lang> segment) or any other node field, so
// folder links, the localStorage collapse-state keys (keyed by node.slug),
// and every other node deeper in the tree are unaffected.
//
// Duplicated (not imported) in wikicommit-breadcrumbs and
// wikicommit-language-switcher — the 3 plugins are independent npm packages
// with no shared workspace, so there's no runtime-shareable module between
// them. tests/test_quartz_plugins_lang_segment_sync.py asserts this literal
// stays byte-identical across all 3 copies (Issue #228).
