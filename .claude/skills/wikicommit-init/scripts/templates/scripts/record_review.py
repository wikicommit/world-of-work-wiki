"""record_review.py — persist one review verdict as an immutable record (Issue #750).

`wikicommit-generate` Pass 4 runs eight distinct checks over every page it
generates — evidence binding (Issue #442), granular fact verification and
naming-vs-inventing (Issue #451), secondary citations (Issue #473),
attribution correctness and unattributed single-source formulations (Issue
#429), source-vs-source disagreement and one-hop cross-page contradiction
(Issue #566) — and then throws the verdict away. Pass 4 step 1 says so in as
many words: the agent-to-agent JSON is "never written to disk or Git".

The consequence is that a page which passed cleanly on the first attempt and a
page that was caught hallucinating and only passed on the second look are
byte-identical on disk. The only thing that survives is `failed_pages`, which
records the reviews that *could not* be salvaged — not the ones that worked.

Four things follow from that, and this script exists to stop all four:

- `## Failure Reason` already admits the gap in its own prescribed wording
  ("that detail is agent-to-agent only and is not persisted here").
- `/wikicommit-fix` silently invalidates the AI review. It rewrites a page's
  prose and `reset_review_on_content_change.py` sends `review_status` back to
  `pending` (Issue #724) — but the machine-side verdict, made against the old
  text, was never recorded, so nothing can notice it has gone stale.
- Risk-based sampling has no input. How many retries a page took and what was
  found in them is precisely the blueprint for deciding which pages a human
  should read, and it evaporated when the run ended.
- Bias cannot be measured, and measurement cannot be built retroactively: a
  period with no records is permanently blank.

## One review is one file, and files are never edited

The record for a page lives in a per-page directory and each review writes a
new file into it:

    .wikicommit/review/entity/ja/Person/yamada-taro/
    ├── 20260905-142233-ai.md      generate Pass 4
    ├── 20260907-091510-ai.md      wikicommit-review, a different model
    └── 20260908-103302-human.md   a human

Create-only beats appending to one file per page on four counts. There is no
read-modify-write, so the round-trip that cost this repository a config file's
worth of comments (Issue #713) cannot happen here. Git merges are trivial
because two branches adding two reviews add two different files. Several
reviewers over one page — the shape a multi-perspective review takes — is
expressed by construction. And a human can read and write these, which
calibration requires: comparing human findings against machine findings means
a human has to be able to read the machine's.

The filename is `<YYYYMMDD>-<HHMMSS>-<kind>.md`, following the existing
`wikicommit/merge-<YYYYMMDD>-<HHMMSS>` branch convention. **The model ID is
deliberately not in the filename**: a runtime reports itself as e.g.
`claude-opus-5[1m]` (Issue #559 saw that exact spelling in real page data) and
square brackets are glob metacharacters.

Records outlive their pages. A deleted page keeps its review history, so this
tree is not a strict mirror of the wiki, and a directory is created for a page
that was never written at all (`result: discarded`) — that being the single
most valuable record here, it is the design rather than an edge case.

## The frontmatter is the record; the body is for prose

Findings go in frontmatter, not in the body. Putting them in the body would
force the aggregation script to parse prose, which is the failure mode Issue
#474 named. The body is for what has no structured home: a human's one-line
observation, an Issue close comment.

`source_quote` is dropped even when the caller passes it. It is verbatim
source text, and systematically accumulating excerpts across a whole wiki is a
different act from quoting one in a page — this project already treats a
source's terms as a matter of fact rather than assumption (`sources[].license`,
Issue #558 / #570), and the same reasoning applies to its own records.
`source_file` plus `source_lines` is enough to go back and look. Dropping it
here rather than in the calling instructions means the guarantee does not
depend on an agent following prose, and it also removes the only path by which
raw source text could enter these records at all — shrinking both the
prompt-injection surface and the file size.

`page_content_hash` uses **the same six-field ignore list** as
`reset_review_on_content_change.py`, imported rather than restated. That is
what makes "is this verdict still valid for the page as it stands?" a
deterministic question, which calibration needs to ask. It is empty for
`result: discarded`, where the page was never written and no hash exists;
an empty hash means exactly that, and staleness checks skip it.

`reviewed_sources` records the source versions the review actually saw, in
full rather than as a digest. The reason it must be a full list is
`check_ingest_freshness.py`, which does not monitor `type: url` sources at all
(URL freshness is re-checked only by re-running `/wikicommit-generate <url>`) —
for a URL source, this record is the only place in the repository that captures which version was in front of a
reviewer. A view page records its `derived_from` entries in the same slot.

`findings` holds **every round**, flat, each tagged with `round:`. Pass 4
retries up to `generate.max_retries` and each round can turn up a different
defect (Issue #571 saw three rounds find three different problems); recording
only the last round would give a page that failed once and was fixed an empty
`findings` list, erasing the one signal most worth having. Flat rather than
nested because every aggregation — totals, counts by `type`, the highest round
reached — is then a single filter. `attempts` is stated separately because it
cannot be recovered from `max(round)` when the final round found nothing.

## Relationship to the agent-to-agent review JSON

That JSON stays agent-to-agent, and stays free to gain fields. What is
persisted is a **projection** of it, and that projection is a compatibility
surface. Do not read "this format may change freely" onto this file (Issue
#750).

Usage:
    python .wikicommit/scripts/record_review.py <page> \\
        --kind ai --stage generate-pass4 \\
        --model "<runtime-reported model id>" \\
        --attempts 2 --result pass \\
        [--skill-blob <hash>] [--reviewer <login>] \\
        [--note <text> | --note-file <path>] \\
        [--sources-from <source management file>]... \\
        [--json <path>|-]

    <page> is a page under `.wikicommit/entity/` or `.wikicommit/view/`. It
    does not have to exist on disk: `result: discarded` is exactly the case
    where it does not.

    0 = a record was written

    never an option: these files are immutable by contract.

    That suffix is why `record_sort_key()` exists: it does not sort lexically after
    the unsuffixed name.

    **The stamp is clamped to the newest record already here (Issue #991.)** Which
    record is current is decided by this order — `standing_review()`,

    written in sequence timestamps in the opposite order, and then the *older* record
    is read as the standing one. Nothing warns: records are immutable by contract
    (Issue #750), so there is no later moment at which the inversion could be noticed.

    Clamping reuses the mechanism that is already here for the same-second case, so
    the documented filename shape is unchanged, `record_sort_key()` is unchanged, and
    existing records stay readable. What it costs is that a clamped record's filename
    is up to a step older than the instant it was written — bounded, and the record's
    own `reviewed_at` still carries the date. The alternative is a silently wrong
    answer to "which review is current", which is the question this tree exists to
    answer.

    The suffix is therefore allocated from `next_seq()` — the stamp, not the exact
    filename. `kind` is not part of the sort key, so a clamped `human` record landing
