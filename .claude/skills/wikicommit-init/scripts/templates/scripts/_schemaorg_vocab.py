"""Shared Schema.org vocabulary loading/lookup for check_schema_org_type.py
and validate_frontmatter.py (Issue #495), extended with rangeIncludes/
DataType lookups for check_schema_org_type.py's entity-vs-scalar range query
(Issue #496 — deciding whether a property's value should be written as a
`[[Type/slug]]` WikiLink).

Lazily builds .wikicommit/schemaorg-vocab.json the first time it's needed
(same build-on-first-query pattern as search_index.py) by fetching the
official machine-readable dump from
https://schema.org/version/latest/schemaorg-current-https.jsonld. Unlike
search_index.sqlite3, this file is committed to Git (Issue #319) rather than
gitignored: it's semi-static reference data with a real network-fetch cost,
not a disposable cache, so it lives at .wikicommit/schemaorg-vocab.json (not
under .wikicommit/.cache/) and is expected to be added to a commit like any
other WikiCommit output. No TTL/auto-refresh — Schema.org's vocabulary
changes rarely, and the only cost of a stale copy is "a newer type isn't
visible yet". As of Issue #512 this cost is no longer purely soft: a `type:`
absent only because the cache predates that type's addition to Schema.org
now makes validate_frontmatter.py's type-existence check (not just its
`properties:` domainIncludes check) report a hard ERROR, blocking
wikicommit-merge for every page of that type until the cache is rebuilt.
Delete .wikicommit/schemaorg-vocab.json manually to force a rebuild against
the latest vocabulary. A cache written by a pre-Issue-#496
version of this module (missing the per-entry "is_datatype"/"range" keys
_build_index() now writes) does not need manual deletion — load_or_build_index()
detects the outdated shape itself via _is_well_shaped_index() and rebuilds
automatically.

Consolidated out of check_schema_org_type.py (Issue #495) so
validate_frontmatter.py's new `properties:` domainIncludes check (verifying
a page's properties: keys actually belong to its `type:`, per the same
domainIncludes + rdfs:subClassOf ancestry logic) can reuse the identical
vocabulary-loading and ancestry-walking logic instead of a second, divergence-
prone copy — the same "one implementation every script imports" precedent as
_frontmatter.py/_wikilink.py.
