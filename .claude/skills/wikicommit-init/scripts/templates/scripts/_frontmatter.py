"""Shared YAML frontmatter parsing for convert_wikilinks.py, check_wikilinks.py,
check_orphans.py, check_translation_status.py, validate_frontmatter.py
(Issue #212), and check_expires.py, check_ingest_freshness.py, search_index.py
(Issue #231).

Previously each script carried its own copy of the `---\\n...\\n---` extraction,
which had drifted apart in ways that were real bugs rather than harmless style
differences:
- BOM handling: some scripts read with `utf-8-sig`, others with plain `utf-8`,
  so a BOM-prefixed page (as some Windows editors write) silently failed
  frontmatter detection in half the scripts.
- Non-dict YAML: `yaml.safe_load(...) or {}` returns the parsed value
  unchanged when it is a non-empty non-mapping (e.g. a page whose frontmatter
  is a YAML list), so callers that then do `fm.get(...)` on it crash instead
  of reporting a clean error.
- Empty-block detection: a regex-based `^---\\n(.*?)\\n---\\n?` extraction (used
  by 4 of the 5 scripts pre-consolidation) never matches a truly empty block
  (`---\\n---\\n`, i.e. zero content lines between the delimiters), because
  there is no second `\\n` separating the two `---` lines for `(.*?)` to sit
  between. That's harmless in the 4 scripts that treated "no match" as "no
  frontmatter" (both give back `{}` anyway), but validate_frontmatter.py's
  own pre-consolidation implementation used a line-scan instead and handled
  this case correctly, distinguishing it from a genuinely unterminated block.
  This module keeps that line-scan approach so the stricter validate_frontmatter.py
  contract (unterminated block *is* a reportable error) stays correct.

Consolidating here follows the same precedent as _wikilink.py (Issue #114):
one implementation that every script imports, instead of divergent copies
that can only be kept in sync by discipline.
