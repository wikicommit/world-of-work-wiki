"""Convert [[Type/slug]] WikiLinks to relative Markdown links for the Quartz build.

Usage:
    python .wikicommit/scripts/convert_wikilinks.py \
        --source .wikicommit/entity/ \
        --output content/ \
        [--primary-lang ja]

Mirrors every .md file under --source into --output, rewriting [[Type/slug]]
WikiLinks into relative Markdown links ([Type/slug](../Type/slug.md)). Links
that cannot be resolved are left untouched and reported as warnings.

Also generates a build-time-only, language-independent content/sources/
tree mirroring .wikicommit/source/ 1:1 — one page per source management
file, plus a content/sources/index.md landing page (Issue #476, replacing
the old per-language content/<lang>/sources.md aggregation keyed off each
page's own `sources` frontmatter — see generate_source_pages()). Like
generate_root_index()'s content/index.md, none of this is LLM-authored wiki
content and all of it is excluded from the review_status /
validate_frontmatter.py quality gate contract.

Exit code: always 0 (unresolved links are warnings only; check_wikilinks.py
is responsible for blocking on broken links during the quality gate).

    Returns `{"model", "reviewed_at", "findings"}` for the newest `kind: ai`
    record whose `page_content_hash` still matches the page on disk.

    Four ways this returns None, and all four must publish the page exactly as
    it published before this feature existed:

    - **No record.** The page predates Issue #750; a record cannot be made
      retroactively, so the blank is permanent and honest.
    - **The verdict is not a pass.** See below.
    - **The verdict is stale.** `/wikicommit-fix` rewrote the page after the
      review, or a source it was judged against changed or left the page, so
      the verdict was made against material that is no longer there. This is
      the reason Issue #751 stamps at publish time instead of copying the
      verdict into the page's own frontmatter: a copy cannot notice it has gone
      stale, which is the failure Issue #705 already cost this repository once.
    - **The record is unreadable**, or the page's own frontmatter will not
      parse. A build must not fail over an annotation.

    `standing_verdict()` — not simply the last record — because a
    `result: discarded` record carries an empty hash and describes a page that
    was never written, so it says nothing about the file being published here.

    Only a `result: pass` verdict is published. `standing_verdict()` answers
    "which record is the current one", which is all `/wikicommit-status` needs
    to measure staleness against — but `wikicommit-review` records
    `--result fail` when its fact-check found something, against a page that is
    still on disk. Publishing that as "checked against sources" would put a
    passing badge on the one page whose latest check failed, and count its
    unfixed findings among those "raised and fixed before publishing". An older
    `pass` is not fallen back to either: a later failure does not stop applying
    because an earlier check once succeeded.

# The four *_LABELS dicts below (root index, source type, source page,
# overview) ship two languages: Japanese here, English in the DEFAULT_*
# fallback beside each one. **That is not a claim that two is the right
# number** — no record exists of anyone deciding on these two. What has been
# decided is the other half: when to add a third.
#
# **Adding one is blocked on verification, not on translation.** A translation
# can be produced for any of these strings at any time. What this project has
# no way to do is check that the result says what the English says, and the
# cost of getting that wrong is not uniform across the keys:
#
#   - Most keys are plain labels ("Sources", "Type", "Total pages"). A clumsy
#     translation is clumsy and nothing more.
#   - A minority carry claims — counts_note, ai_counts_note, licensing,
#     reviewed_note, retracted_notice. Those sentences say what this wiki does
#     and does not vouch for, what its sources permit, and why a source was
#     dropped. Several of them exist specifically to keep this wiki from
#     overstating what it knows.
#
# **The second kind fails invisibly.** Left in English it fails visibly: a
# reader who cannot read it knows they cannot. Mistranslated slightly stronger,
# it reads fine and the reader believes something this wiki deliberately does
# not say — and nobody here can see that it happened.
#
# **A partial language is not an option today.** These dicts are read with
# bracket access, so one missing key raises KeyError and fails the build. That
# is a guarantee, not a defect — a language is complete or absent, never
# half-rendered. The one exception is SOURCE_TYPE_LABELS, whose values are
# looked up with .get(source_type, source_type) and degrade to the bare type
# string instead.
#
# **To add a language**, add it to all four dicts in the same change as the
# translations themselves. There is no registry to keep in step (they are keyed
# by primary_lang directly, unlike the Quartz plugins' LANG_TO_LOCALE), but
# they are four independent dicts, so adding to one and not the rest is silent:
# that wiki gets a translated root index and English source pages.
#
# **A language with no entry renders in English**, per surface, via the
# DEFAULT_* dict.
#
# **The published pages do not say that the fallback happened** (Issue #825).
# The question was whether a reader should be told, rather than being shown
# English as if it were the site's language, and the answer is no. Three
# reasons, in the order they decide it:
#
#   - **A notice would not restore what was lost.** The English string *is* the
#     canonical wording — the other language's entry would be a translation of
#     it — so a reader who can read English has already received the claim, and
#     learning that Italian was intended changes nothing about what this wiki
#     vouches for. A reader who cannot read English cannot read the notice
#     either.
#   - **A language-independent marker only restates what is already visible.**
#     A flag or an `(en)` tag says "this is English", which is exactly what
#     English text in an Italian page already says. That was the point of
#     leaving it in English: the failure is visible without help.
#   - **It would be a standing notice on every surface of every page**, one
#     nobody can act on — a reader cannot supply the missing labels. That is the
#     shape a reader stops seeing, and it would buy the fade at the cost of
#     weight on the banner, where two Issues already hold the line against
#     adding any.
#
# **The operator is told instead, once**, by `init.py` when they choose a
# primary_lang this project has no labels for. They are the one person who can
# act on it, and telling them costs the published pages nothing. Do not read
# this as "the fallback is fine and needs no disclosure" — it is disclosed, to
# the party that can do something with it.

    `targets` is the set of languages this wiki declared it translates into, and
    existing_lang_targets() narrows it to those that really have pages (Issue
    #190). `published_langs` closes the opposite gap (Issue #731): a language
    can have real pages without appearing in `targets` at all, and the root
    index is the only entry point that was deriving its language list from
    `targets` alone, so those pages were published but unreachable from the
    front door. The pipeline produces this state itself — `/wikicommit-translate
    <page> --lang <lang>` writes a translation without touching config.yml, and
    its own error message points at that option as the alternative to editing
    `targets` — and it also arises from hand-added pages, from changing
    `primary_lang` later, and from removing a language from `targets` after its
    translations exist.

    Union rather than replacement: existing_lang_targets() admits a language on
    the strength of any non-removed `.md` under it, including one whose path
    never resolves to `<lang>/<Type>/<slug>.md`, whereas `published_langs` is
    built from resolved, published pages only. Dropping the targets side would
    therefore remove languages that are linked today. (Both cover the view tree,
    so that is not the difference between them.)

    Ordering keeps existing sites stable: `targets` is written by a person, so
    its order is theirs to keep, and discovered languages follow it (the caller
    sorts them) rather than interleaving.

    """Write a root content/index.md that links to the wiki top page(s).

    Quartz's FolderPage plugin deliberately skips generating a virtual index
    page for the content root (it filters out the "." folder), so without a
    real index.md the site root never gets an index.html. The content-index
    plugin's RSS feed defaults to the "index" slug regardless, so index.xml
    ends up as the only "index"-named file at the root and is what gets
    served for "/" (GitHub Issue #75).

    Always overwritten, like convert_file(). An earlier version skipped
    writing when content/index.md already existed, reasoning that
    .wikicommit/entity/ has no root-level page by design so a pre-existing file
    could only be a real mirrored page not to be clobbered. In practice that
    guard fired on the file this same function wrote on a previous local
    build (package.json's prebuild script never clears content/ between
    `npm run build`/`npm run preview` runs), permanently freezing this page's
    content — and because main()'s stale-cleanup treats a guard-skipped write
    the same as a real one, the frozen file was never swept up either
    (Issue #358).

    total_pages/reviewed_pages (Issue #407) are embedded as custom frontmatter
    fields so the WikiCommitBanner Quartz component can render a site-wide
    summary (total page count, reviewed count) on this page without re-deriving
    them from `allFiles` at render time — this script already walks every wiki
    page once in main(), so computing the aggregate here avoids a second,
    TSX-side pass that would have to duplicate the same index.md/removed-page
    exclusions.

    config.yml's `theme` was also embedded here (as `wikicommit_theme`) until
    Issue #670. It is an LLM-facing scope instruction — read by
    wikicommit-generate Pass 2c and wikicommit-collect, not by readers — held as
    a single string in whatever language it was written in, so on a multilingual
    site it reached every reader in one language, and it often carried
    source-selection prose aimed at the generator. A reader-facing site
    description belongs in a field written for readers; it is not this one.

    `site_description` (Issue #671) is that field: {lang: text}, rendered into
    the body rather than the frontmatter. Two reasons it is not another
    frontmatter field for the banner to draw. (1) It is a per-language mapping,
    which does not fit a single frontmatter string. (2) Putting each
    description directly under its own language's link removes the need for a
    "Description:" caption at all, so it sidesteps the banner i18n's two-locale
    limit — a description written in any language reaches that language's
    readers, whereas a caption could not. Languages with no entry simply get no
    description; an absent field reproduces the previous output exactly.

    `lang_counts` (Issue #730, extended by Issue #769) is
    {lang: (pages, reviewed, ai_reviewed)} counted from the pages this build
    published. On a multilingual wiki the two frontmatter fields above are
    omitted entirely and these per-language counts take their place in the body,
    one pair per language link. Two reasons the single
    site-wide total was wrong there. (1) Nobody experiences it: this page exists
    to choose a language, and the wiki behind each choice is one language's
    worth of pages — a translation is the same knowledge again, not more of it.
    (2) It dilutes the reviewed ratio: a fully reviewed original alongside two
    untouched translations reports one third, and that number was reframed by
    Issue #664 as a statement about the trust ladder, so translations drag it
    away from what it means to claim. Splitting pages but not reviewed counts
    would leave (2) intact, so both are split.

    `ai_reviewed_pages` (Issue #769) is the site-wide count of pages carrying a
    standing AI verdict, embedded as a third frontmatter field on a
    single-language wiki. It is omitted at zero rather than written as 0, and
    that is accuracy rather than tidiness: a wiki predating the review tree has
    no records (they are never created retroactively), which is not the same
    claim as "nothing was checked". On a multilingual wiki the per-language
    third number in `lang_counts` takes its place, for the same reason the other
    two are split there.

    Omitting the two fields is what suppresses the banner's site summary: it
    renders only when both are numbers, so no change to WikiCommitBanner.tsx is
    needed — but Issue #664's note explaining what "reviewed" counts is part of
    that same block and would disappear with it, so it is re-emitted here under
    the language list. A single-language wiki has no language list to hang any
    of this off, so it keeps both fields and the banner as before.

    The "sources" entry point links to content/sources/ — a single,
    language-independent tree (the source tree itself has no `lang` concept) built by
    generate_source_pages(), not one link per lang like the old per-language
    content/<lang>/sources.md this replaced (Issue #476).

    already writes its own index.md explicitly instead of relying on Quartz's

    Generalized over every source type in SOURCE_TYPE_ORDER rather than

    already wrote a real mirrored source page to (one per source management
    file, via _write_source_page()). A management file whose own mirrored
    path happens to end in `index.md` — a `type: path` source for a
    repo file literally named `index.*` (e.g. `src/index.js`), or a
    `type: url` source sanitized from a URL whose path is `/index`
    (the same `/index` collision class already solved once at the
    bare-domain-vs-path layer for Issue #213) — produces an
    intermediate-directory index_rel identical
    to that real page's own path. Skipping the generic directory listing for
    any such path avoids silently overwriting the real source page with a
    bare subdirectory/file listing (the real page already satisfies
    Explorer's need for an index.md there, so there is nothing to fill in).

# ── Wiki-wide overview page (Issue #585) ───────────────────────────────────────
#
# A reader or operator arriving at the published site has no single place that
# answers "what knowledge is in here, and what is missing?". The pieces exist,
# scattered: the root index carries three numbers (Issue #407), content/sources/
# shows one source at a time (Issue #476), each type's index.md lists that type
# alone, and /wikicommit-status's orphan/wanted tallies never leave the console.
#
# Like generate_root_index() and generate_source_pages(), this is a
# build-generated page: it has no file under .wikicommit/entity/ and is
# rewritten from scratch on every build. That is deliberate. Its content is
# recomputed aggregate, not something a human reviews once — putting it under
# .wikicommit/entity/ would subject numbers that change every build to
# review_status, a review-tracking Issue (Issue #313) and the wikicommit-merge
# quality gate.
#
# Everything here is derived from data main() and generate_source_pages()
# already collect. In particular nothing calls check_ingest_freshness.py, which
# rewrites management files (`status: outdated`) as a side effect: a build must
# never modify the repository it is building. `expires_at` is likewise left to
# /wikicommit-status, since "today" would freeze at build time and quietly go
# stale until the next deploy.

# Two languages, and the note above ROOT_INDEX_LABELS says why adding a
# third is gated on verification rather than translation. All four
# *_LABELS dicts have to gain the language in the same change.

    of `Type/slug` keys linking at it, `removed_keys` holds the keys of pages
    skipped as `status: removed`, and `source_stats` is what
    generate_source_pages() tallied.

    Counting is by key, not by page: a WikiLink carries no language, so a page
    and its translations are one node here. Every count would otherwise double
    the moment a wiki gains a second language, without a single new link having
    been written. Each key is represented by its primary-language page wherever
    one page has to stand in for the node (hub rows, referrer links).

    Three deliberate differences from check_orphans.py / check_wanted_pages.py,
    which compute the same graph over .wikicommit/entity/:

    - Removed pages contribute no outbound links here. They are not published,
      so a link only they make cannot be followed by any reader of this site.
      A page kept alive solely by a removed page's link is therefore an orphan
      on this page while check_orphans.py still counts it as referenced.
    - A wanted key whose slug exists under a different Type is dropped rather
      than listed. Issue #563 established that such a link is a Type typo, not
      a missing page; telling a reader to write a page that already exists is
      worse than saying nothing. check_wanted_pages.py reports those as
      TYPE_MISMATCH for the operator, which is the right audience for them.
    - A page's link to itself is not a backlink to itself, so a page whose only
      inbound link is its own is an orphan here. check_orphans.py counts it as
      referenced.

    One page kind reaches neither: a .md that does not resolve to
    <lang>/<Type>/<slug>.md has no key to place it under, so it is absent from
    every tally here while still counting toward the root index's
    wikicommit_page_count (Issue #407). Such a file is not a wiki page in the
    sense the rest of the pipeline uses.

    links, the third the set of `Type/slug` keys it references.

    link_keys is the page's outbound edge list for the overview page's link
    graph (Issue #585). It is collected here, during the substitution pass
    that already reads the file and already runs WIKILINK_RE over it, rather
    than in a second walk: check_orphans.py and check_wanted_pages.py each
    build this same graph from their own full re-read, and adding a third one
    inside the build would be the most expensive of the three (it runs on
    every deploy).

    `rel_path` is the page's path relative to its own tree's root.
    `out_rel_path` is where it is written under output_dir; it defaults to
    `rel_path` and differs for a custom type, whose `custom/` segment
    publishing drops (Issue #576), and for a view page, which gains a `View`
    segment it does not have on disk (Issue #675). main() computes it once and
    passes it here *and* into its stale-cleanup write set — the two must be the
    same value, or the cleanup pass deletes this file in the same run that
    wrote it (Issue #271).

    `is_view` says which tree `src_path` belongs to; `view_dir` is the view
    tree's root, needed either way to resolve `[[View/<slug>]]` links written
    from an ordinary page.

    `ai_review` is what load_ai_review() found for this page, stamped into the
    published copy's frontmatter and nowhere else (Issue #751). main() looks it
    up so the overview's site-wide tally and this stamp read one lookup, and so

    Quartz's builtin Assets emitter copies everything under content/ that isn't
    a .md to the published site, and it is registered unconditionally (not via
    quartz.config.yaml's plugins list), so putting a file here is all that is
    needed to publish it. Nothing in the pipeline did that before, which meant
    the recommended relative-path form for local images resolved to a 404 on
    the published site — that recommendation had been verified by placing files
    directly into content/ rather than going through this script.

    One non-obvious dependency this relies on: Quartz's Assets emitter globs
    with `gitignore: true`, and the distributed .gitignore lists `content/`.
    That only fails to hide the assets because `npm run build` runs
    `npx quartz build` from inside the quartz/ submodule, so the glob's cwd is
    quartz/content (a symlink created by prebuild-symlinks.cjs) and the
    gitignore scan starts inside the submodule's own repo rather than the wiki
    repo's. Pointing the build at the repo-root content/ instead would make
    globby match nothing and silently publish no assets at all (verified
    directly against globby).

    Only the assets/ subtree is mirrored, not every non-.md file under
    source_dir: assets/ is the one place for shared images and attachments,
    and limiting the copy there avoids
    publishing whatever else happens to sit next to a page (editor backups, a
    stray source PDF, .DS_Store).

    Note that Quartz's Assets emitter excludes `**/*.md`, so a .md placed under
    assets/ is copied here but then rendered by Quartz as an ordinary page
    rather than served as a downloadable attachment (the warning below says so
    explicitly instead of suggesting a rename, which cannot help: every .md
    loses its extension). It is still excluded from this script's own page
    conversion (see main()), so it is only ever written once.
