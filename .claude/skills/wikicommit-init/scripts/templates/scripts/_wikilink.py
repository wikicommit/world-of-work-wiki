"""Shared WikiLink parsing helpers for check_orphans.py, check_wikilinks.py,
and convert_wikilinks.py (Issue #114).

Previously each script carried its own copy of WIKILINK_RE and its own
path→(Type, slug) conversion function, which had drifted out of sync (e.g.
convert_wikilinks.py's regex was missing the double-slash-rejection fix that
check_orphans.py / check_wikilinks.py picked up in PR #109). Consolidating
here means the three scripts (and their templates/ mirrors) can only drift by
skipping the shared import, not by editing divergent logic in place.

Sibling-imports _frontmatter (build_slug_type_index needs each page's status:),
so anything loading this module — including a test that exec_module()s it
directly — must have the scripts directory on sys.path first. Every script that
imports it lives in that same directory, so this holds at runtime by default.
