"""check_extraction_quality.py — shared by wikicommit-generate and wikicommit-collect.

Pass 1's original extraction-failure check only catches text that is empty or
unreadable. It does not catch text that is non-empty but useless: a
JavaScript-rendering-required page fetched with a static tool (markitdown,
curl) can return a non-empty "shell" (nav links, login prompts, embedded
JSON/JS state) with none of the page's actual content. This was confirmed for
https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383 in the ai-driven-dev-wiki
pilot: the management file recorded status: generated with 1060
extracted_tokens, but the extracted text contained zero occurrences of the
tweet's own wording — see Issue #425 for the full writeup.

This script implements the two checks Issue #425 designed for that gap:

(B) check-domain: run *before* attempting extraction, from the URL alone.
    Domains confirmed to sometimes return an empty shell are skipped outright
    (no fetch attempted) — precise but only covers domains someone has
    already observed failing this way.
(C) check-fetch-capability: run *before* attempting extraction, from the URL
    alone. Some hosts need an optional Python package for markitdown to reach
    the part of the page that actually carries the content — for YouTube, the
    video's transcript comes only from `youtube_transcript_api`, and without it
    markitdown silently returns just the title/keywords/runtime/description
    with no error at all (Issue #574). That is a different axis from (A) and
    (B): the page is neither an empty shell nor low-density prose, it is a
    genuine partial extraction, so neither of the other two guards can see it.
(A) check-density: run *after* extraction, on the extracted text. A general,
    domain-agnostic heuristic that estimates what fraction of the text looks
    like natural-language prose versus markup/code/data. Lower precision than
    (B), but catches domains nobody has flagged yet.

The two guards are deliberately *not* equally strong (Issue #562). (B) is a
deterministic verdict about a domain someone has already confirmed broken, so
wikicommit-generate treats its exit 1 as blocking. (A) is a shape heuristic,
and a link-dense government site or a statistics table has essentially the same
text shape as a JS shell — the saitama-wiki pilot saw 4 of 8 genuine sources
flagged, and the operator overrode every one. Its exit 1 is therefore a warning
that Pass 1 raises with the human, not an automatic failure; the LOW_DENSITY
line carries a breakdown of the non-prose characters so that decision has
something concrete behind it.

wikicommit-generate's Pass 1 runs all three checks; wikicommit-collect's
candidate search runs check-domain only.

Usage:
    python .wikicommit/scripts/check_extraction_quality.py check-domain <url>
    python .wikicommit/scripts/check_extraction_quality.py check-fetch-capability <url>
    python .wikicommit/scripts/check_extraction_quality.py check-density <file>

Exit code: 0 = OK, 1 = blocked (check-domain, blocking) / missing package
(check-fetch-capability, blocking) / low density
(check-density, warning — see above) / file could not be read (check-density).
