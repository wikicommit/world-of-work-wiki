"""Verify that a Schema.org type (and optionally its properties) exist in the
official Schema.org vocabulary, or list every type name + one-line
description for preloading into an LLM's context.

Deterministic counterpart to the LLM judgment in wikicommit-generate's
`better_type_candidate` / `better_type_rationale` (Pass 2) and
wikicommit-schema-propose (Issue #285): this script can only confirm that a
type/property *exists* and that a property really belongs to the given type
(including its ancestor types). Whether the type is actually the *right*
semantic fit for a Wiki's content is a judgment left to the LLM and to human
PR review — this script does not attempt it.

Usage:
    python .wikicommit/scripts/check_schema_org_type.py --type <TypeName> [--property <PropertyName>]... [--show-range]
    python .wikicommit/scripts/check_schema_org_type.py --type <TypeName> --list-properties
    python .wikicommit/scripts/check_schema_org_type.py --list-type-names
    python .wikicommit/scripts/check_schema_org_type.py --describe <TypeName>...
    python .wikicommit/scripts/check_schema_org_type.py --list-installed-hierarchy

`--list-type-names` and `--describe` are the two halves of type recall
(Issue #798). The three Skills that propose a type (wikicommit-init's
theme-driven step, wikicommit-collect's Type Proposal, wikicommit-generate
Pass 2b) each hold a short piece of text and need the vocabulary to jog a
candidate loose from it. That is *recall*, not verification — whether a type
actually exists is settled afterwards by `--type`, deterministically.

Recall does not need every description. `--list-type-names` prints the 933
type names alone (13 KB); the Skill picks a handful of candidates from them
and calls `--describe Park Museum ...` for just those descriptions (under a
kilobyte). Together that is ~14 KB against the 147 KB the old `--list-types`
put into the main context on every run, unconditionally and regardless of how
many sources were being processed.

`--list-types` (name + description for all 933) **was removed**, not kept
alongside. Once the three Skills moved to the two-stage form it had no caller,
and shipping the expensive path while documenting that nothing should use it
is the receptacle-without-a-consumer shape this project keeps out (Issue #553).
`--describe` covers the same need on demand.

`--describe` errors on a name that is not in the vocabulary rather than
silently omitting it: stage one hands the model 933 real names, so a name that
does not come back is an invention, and it is better caught here than carried
into the approval step.

`--list-installed-hierarchy` (Issue #565) prints one line per Schema.org type
installed in `.wikicommit/schema/`, tab-separated: the type, then its
*installed* ancestor types nearest-first (or `-`) — this is what
wikicommit-generate Pass 2c uses to prefer the most specific installed type,
since an ancestor type always fits and would otherwise win by familiarity.
Like `--list-type-names` it takes no other arguments and ignores them if given.

`--show-range` (Issue #496) adds one `RANGE:` line per verified `--property`,
reporting whether that property's Schema.org `rangeIncludes` points at
linkable entity type(s) (e.g. `affiliation` -> `Organization`), plain
DataType scalar(s) (e.g. `description` -> `Text`/`TextObject`), or a mix of
both (e.g. `jobTitle` -> `DefinedTerm` and `Text`) — this is what
wikicommit-generate Pass 2c/Pass 3 uses to decide whether a `properties:`
value should be written as a `[[Type/slug]]` WikiLink instead of a plain
scalar. Purely informational: `RANGE:` lines never affect the exit code or
`errors` count, and are only printed for a property that already verified OK
(a property that failed --property verification has no range worth reporting).

`--type <TypeName> --list-properties` (Issue #497) prints every property
available to that type — its own `domainIncludes` plus everything inherited
via its `rdfs:subClassOf` ancestry — one per line, tab-separated: property
name, declaring type(s) (which ancestor's domainIncludes it comes from),
entity-type WikiLink candidates from `rangeIncludes` (or `-` if none), and a
one-line description. This is the on-demand, per-type equivalent of
`--list-type-names`: a reference for picking what to put in a new (or existing)
type's `properties:` block, without pre-generating and maintaining a static
per-type template file (rejected design, see the Issue's background — that
would double-manage the same data schemaorg-vocab.json already holds and
defeats the schema layer's whole point of narrowing the field, not listing
everything). Takes priority over `--property`/`--show-range` when both
`--type` and `--list-properties` are given; `--list-type-names`, `--describe`
and then `--list-installed-hierarchy` take priority over everything if given
alongside `--type`.

Vocabulary loading/caching (.wikicommit/schemaorg-vocab.json) and the
domainIncludes/rangeIncludes/rdfs:subClassOf ancestry logic live in the
shared _schemaorg_vocab.py module (Issue #495, extended by Issues #496/#497),
also used by validate_frontmatter.py's `properties:` field validation.

Exit code: 0 = the type (and every given property) exists and, for
properties, belongs to the type or one of its ancestor types; or
--list-type-names/--describe/--list-installed-hierarchy/--list-properties
completed. 1 = the type does not exist, a property does not exist or does not
belong to the type lineage, a --describe name is not in the vocabulary, the
vocabulary could not be fetched/parsed, --list-properties was given without
--type, or none of --type/--list-type-names/--describe/
--list-installed-hierarchy was given.
