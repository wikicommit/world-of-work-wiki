// Every component-bearing plugin here ships this test (Issue #186/#379/#399).
// A plugin directory ships standalone — once wikicommit-init copies it into a
// user's wiki repo it has no node_modules of its own — so a bare
// `import ... from "preact"` in dist/index.js cannot be resolved at Quartz
// build time; tsup's automatic JSX runtime has to inline the vnode helpers
// instead. Upstream github:quartz-community/graph sets `noExternal: [/.*/]`,
// which bundles everything indiscriminately and defeats SINGLETON_EXTERNALS;
// the fork narrows that to preact + preact/jsx-runtime, and this test is what
// keeps the narrowing honest. Only the real tsup build can catch this class of
// regression — unit tests run against the pre-JSX-transform source.
//
// It also exercises the inlineScriptPlugin path (graph.inline.ts), which
// imports src/util/nodeFilter.ts and src/util/controlBar.ts: that loader runs
// its own isolated esbuild.build(), so a failure to bundle either import would
// surface here rather than in typecheck. Every module the inline script pulls
// in needs an assertion of its own — an unresolved specifier is not a build
// error, it is a page that loads a script the browser then refuses to run.
