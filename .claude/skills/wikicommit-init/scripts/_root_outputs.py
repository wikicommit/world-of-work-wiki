"""The one list of what a freshly initialized repository has to commit (Issue #642).

`init.py` writes these files and `print_next_steps.py` tells the user to
`git add` them. Those were two independently hand-maintained lists (three,
counting the prose in SKILL.md), and the failure mode is not hypothetical:
`install-local-plugins.cjs` was added to `init.py` alone (Issue #434) and left
out of the guidance, so every repository initialized with `--quartz
--quartz-pages` failed its first GitHub Pages build with a `postinstall`
MODULE_NOT_FOUND (Issue #556 — reproduced in two pilots). Issue #556 added a
test that *detects* that drift; this module removes the second list instead, so
adding a root-level output is one edit rather than two or three.

Three kinds of entry do not fit "init.py writes it, the user commits it", and
each needs to stay expressible here rather than being special-cased at the call
site:

  - `.gitmodules` and `quartz` are in the guidance but nobody generates them —
    the user runs `git submodule add` (origin `submodule`). A test that walks
    this list has to know not to expect them on disk.
  - `.wikicommit/schemaorg-vocab.json` exists only when a type-proposal step
    actually hit the network (`condition="vocab_cache"`). `git add` aborts on a
    pathspec that does not exist, which would take the whole foundational commit
    down with it, so it is appended only when the caller says it was created.
  - `package-lock.json` is a side effect of `npm install` (origin `npm`), and is
    deliberately *not* in the `git add` line for that same abort-on-missing
    reason — `print_next_steps.py` guides it as its own command (Issue #556).
    `in_git_add=False` records that this is a decision, not an omission.

Since Issue #842 the printed default is `git add -A`, so neither of the last two
cases can take the foundational commit down any more: a file that is not there is
simply not staged. Both mechanisms stay, because the rendered list did not go away
— it is printed underneath as the fallback for a repository that WikiCommit was
added to rather than made for, and it is a list of individual pathspecs there, with
the same abort-on-missing behaviour. `in_git_add=False` is kept for the second
reason above as well: it is the record that the omission was decided.

`.claude/` is listed too though `install.sh` (not `init.py`) puts it there: the
list describes what the first commit must contain, and that is the question the
guidance answers.

# never byte-match a real repository, so byte comparison would light permanently. A warning

    **This is the question, and "did this run write the file" was standing in for it**

    first init every later one logs `SKIPPED: .gitignore (already exists)`, and a condition
    keyed on that log stops the foundational-commit offer in a repository WikiCommit made
    itself, where `git add -A` is exactly as safe as it was the first time. The fact worth
    protecting is whether the patterns are *there*, not who put them there.

    The same run can also print `SKIPPED: .gitignore (already exists)` and
    `UPDATED: .gitignore (Quartz ignore patterns)` for one path, because the Quartz append
    does not branch on whether the copy happened — a second way the log was the wrong thing
    to read.

    **An empty result does not widen what `-A` can stage.** A repository WikiCommit was
    added to keeps its own `.gitignore`, and `.wikicommit/.cache/` and `.wikicommit/run/`
    are WikiCommit-specific paths that an unrelated one has no reason to carry — so it
    still comes back non-empty and the offer is still withheld. The one exception is a user
    who followed the printed guidance and added those patterns by hand, which is the state
    that guidance asks for.

    A repository initialized before a pattern entered the template (e.g. `.wikicommit/run/`,
    added in Issue #790) comes back non-empty, and **that is correct rather than a false
    positive**: `always_skip_existing` means a re-init does not add it, so `-A` really would
    stage the run records. `check_distribution_freshness.py` reports the same gap as
    `OUTDATED`.
