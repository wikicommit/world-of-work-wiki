description: Fix a wiki page based on a GitHub Issue, a page path, or a published page URL, using its sources as ground truth. Use this only when someone explicitly asks to fix or correct a specific wiki page. It rewrites page content, so do not use it to answer a question about a page or to look for problems across the wiki — wikicommit-ask and wikicommit-status do those without writing.

# wikicommit-fix

> **Paths in this file.** `references/…`, `scripts/…` and `../<other-skill>/…` are relative to this Skill's directory — the one holding this `SKILL.md`, which the runtime names when it loads the Skill — not to the repository root, because the Skills may be installed under `.claude/skills/` or `.agents/skills/`. Commands still run from the repository root, so spell the path out from there (`python <this Skill's directory>/scripts/…`). Paths starting with `.wikicommit/` are repository-root paths as before.

An AI-assisted skill that fixes typos, factual errors, and missing information reported for a wiki page, cross-checking against the target page's `sources` (the original documents). Because the flow is a thin sequence of identifying the feedback and the target page → generating a fix proposal → human confirmation → calling `wikicommit-merge`, this skill has no dedicated scripts.

Feedback can be supplied three ways: as a GitHub Issue (the only route with automatic traceback to an originating Issue in Step 7), as a repo-relative page path with an inline free-text instruction, or as a published-wiki page URL with an inline free-text instruction.

## Usage

```
/wikicommit-fix <issue-url>                                    # Issue-driven: e.g. /wikicommit-fix https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/42
/wikicommit-fix <page-path> "<fix instruction>"                 # Page-path-driven: e.g. /wikicommit-fix .wikicommit/entity/ja/Person/yamada-taro.md "生年を1981年に修正して"
                                                                #                   or /wikicommit-fix .wikicommit/view/ja/agent-loops.md "根拠の弱い箇所を削って"
/wikicommit-fix <published-page-url> "<fix instruction>"        # Published-URL-driven: e.g. /wikicommit-fix https://example.github.io/ja/Person/yamada-taro "生年を1981年に修正して"
```

## Processing Flow

### Step 1: Identify the Input Route, Then Fetch Feedback Content

Determine which of the three input forms was given, in this order:

1. **Issue-driven**: the first argument matches a GitHub Issue URL (`https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<number>`). Parse `owner/repo` and the issue number, then run:

   ```bash
   gh issue view <issue-number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json title,body,url,comments
   ```

   If `gh` authentication fails or the issue doesn't exist, display the error as-is and stop. The feedback content for Step 4 is the Issue's `body` plus every comment's `body`, concatenated — on an auto-generated review-tracking Issue the body is a fixed checklist template, so the feedback is usually in a comment. If a second argument was also given, ignore it (a free-text instruction has no role here — feedback always comes from the Issue itself) and note that to the user.

2. **Page-path-driven**: the first argument starts with `.wikicommit/entity/` or `.wikicommit/view/` (a view page is fixed the same way any page is; it is `derived_from` rather than `sources` that Step 4 then reads for grounding). If it doesn't resolve to an existing file, display "Page not found: `<page-path>`" and stop (don't fall through to the generic usage message below — either prefix unambiguously signals page-path-driven intent, most likely a typo, not a different input form). Otherwise, a second argument (the free-text fix instruction) is required — if missing, display an error asking for it and stop. The feedback content for Step 4 is that second argument verbatim.

3. **Published-URL-driven**: the first argument is a URL that isn't a GitHub Issue URL. A second argument (the free-text fix instruction) is required — if missing, display an error asking for it and stop. The feedback content for Step 4 is that second argument verbatim. Resolving this URL to a target page happens in Step 2.

If none of the above match (unrecognized input — not an Issue URL, not a `.wikicommit/entity/`- or `.wikicommit/view/`-prefixed path, not a URL), display the Usage block above and stop.

### Step 2: Identify the Target Page

**Issue-driven**:

1. If the Issue body explicitly states a path starting with `.wikicommit/entity/` or `.wikicommit/view/`, use it as the target page.
2. If not explicitly stated, extract keywords from the Issue title/body and search under `.wikicommit/entity/` and `.wikicommit/view/` (use the `wikicommit-search` skill if it's installed; otherwise fall back to a plain text search over those directories).
3. If the search returns multiple results, present the candidate list (path + title + `type`) to the user and let them choose. If there are zero results, display an error and stop.

**Page-path-driven**: the target page is the path from Step 1 directly — no search needed.

**Published-URL-driven**: reverse-resolve the URL to a `.wikicommit/entity/` or `.wikicommit/view/` path. The build pipeline mirrors `.wikicommit/entity/<lang>/<Type>/<slug>.md` to `content/<lang>/<Type>/<slug>.md` verbatim (`.wikicommit/scripts/convert_wikilinks.py`), but Quartz's own slug transformation of the `<Type>` path segment beyond that point isn't something this repo can verify — so **do not** try to reconstruct `<Type>` from the URL. Instead, extract only `<lang>` (the URL path's first segment) and `<slug>` (its last segment, stripping a trailing `.html` if present) and resolve using those two alone, which are far less likely to have been case-transformed by the build than a multi-word `<Type>` segment:

```bash
python3 -c "
import sys, os, glob
from urllib.parse import urlparse

url = sys.argv[1]
segments = [s for s in urlparse(url).path.strip('/').split('/') if s]
if len(segments) < 2:
    print('ERROR: could not extract both <lang> and <slug> from the URL path')
    sys.exit(1)
lang = segments[0].lower()
slug = segments[-1]
if slug.lower().endswith('.html'):
    slug = slug[:-5]

# Both trees: a view page publishes to content/<lang>/View/<slug>.md from
# .wikicommit/view/<lang>/<slug>.md, so a published URL can name either one
# and <lang> is the first segment in both cases.
roots = [d for d in (f'.wikicommit/entity/{lang}', f'.wikicommit/view/{lang}') if os.path.isdir(d)]
if not roots:
    print(f'ERROR: no .wikicommit/entity/{lang}/ or .wikicommit/view/{lang}/ directory (unrecognized <lang> segment \"{lang}\")')
    sys.exit(1)

all_pages = [p for root in roots for p in glob.glob(f'{root}/**/*.md', recursive=True)]
matches = sorted(p for p in all_pages if os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(p))[0].lower() == slug.lower())

if not matches:
    print(f'NOT_FOUND: no page under {" / ".join(roots)} with slug \"{slug}\"')
elif len(matches) == 1:
    print(f'MATCH: {matches[0]}')
else:
    for m in matches:
        print(f'CANDIDATE: {m}')
" "$(cat <<'EOF'
<published-page-url>
EOF
)"
```

The free-text-in-shell-argument rule applies here even though the value looks like a URL — it is unvalidated text from the user, and the heredoc-via-command-substitution form is what keeps a URL containing shell metacharacters from being evaluated by the shell during command assembly.

Matching is deliberately by `<slug>` alone across every `<Type>` directory under that `<lang>`, not `<lang>/<Type>/<slug>` — this is what makes the lookup independent of Quartz's `<Type>`-segment casing. Handle the three possible outcomes:

- `MATCH: <path>` → use it as the target page.
- `CANDIDATE: <path>` (one or more lines) → the slug exists under more than one `<Type>` for this `<lang>` (e.g. both `Person/tokyo.md` and `Place/tokyo.md`). Present the candidate list (path + title + `type`, same presentation as the Issue-driven multi-result case above) and let the user choose.
- `NOT_FOUND:` / `ERROR:` → display the message as-is and stop.

**All routes**: once the target page is determined, read its frontmatter. If the page has `status: removed`, tell the user and confirm whether to proceed.

### Step 3: Fetch the Source Document

1. Check the target page's frontmatter `sources`.
2. If `sources` is empty and the page is a translated page with `translated_from`, read the parent page pointed to by `translated_from` and use the parent page's `sources` instead (translated pages inherit source information from the parent page).
3. **Once the `sources` list is settled, and before fetching anything, drop the entries a human has withdrawn.** Run `python .wikicommit/scripts/check_retracted_sources.py --list` once; every `RETRACTED: <identity> (<management file>)` line names a source whose management file carries `status: retracted`, written by hand to record that someone read that document and judged its content unreliable. Match those identities against this page's `sources[]` by `path`/`url` and **leave the matching entries out of the fetch below**, keeping a note of which ones and of the management file each was named in — Step 4 and Step 6 both need it. Grounding a fix in a document a person withdrew points the opposite way from the withdrawal itself.
   - **Before the fetch, not after**: fetching costs a round trip and, worse, puts the withdrawn text into context, after which "do not use it" depends on instruction-following.
   - **After the `sources` list is settled, not before**: a translated page has no `sources` of its own and inherits the parent's at item 2, so a guard applied earlier would let a withdrawn source through on exactly those pages.
   - If the script or the `--list` flag is not there (an older `.wikicommit/scripts/`), **say so and carry on** — the only loss is this guard, and on a wiki that has retracted nothing it is a no-op either way. Do not stop over it, and do not pass over it in silence.
4. For each element of `sources`, get the source document according to `source.type`:
   - `type: path` and `.md` / `.txt` → read the file directly (these are never cached — the raw file is the extracted text)
   - `type: path` with any other extension, and `type: url` / `type: wikicommit` → **ask for WikiCommit's extraction cache first**, then fall back as described below the list
   - `type: manual` → no source document. Treat only `sources`' `author` / `created_at` as provenance information, and use the page body itself as the basis for the fix

   **Getting a cached or fetched source**. `wikicommit-generate` keeps the text it extracted from each source, and that is what this step should read: it is the literal text, not a summary, and it is usually the very version the page was written from.

   ```bash
   python ../wikicommit-ask/scripts/resolve_source_cache_path.py --type <path|url> <<'EOF'
   <sources[].path or sources[].url>
   EOF
   ```

   `--type path` for a `type: path` entry, `--type url` for `type: url` / `type: wikicommit`. **Exit 0** → read the printed file in full; that is this source's text. **For `type: path`, use it only if the file at `sources[].path` still hashes to that entry's `sources[].hash`** (compute the file's SHA-256 with `sha256sum`, or `python3 -c` + `hashlib` where that is absent): the script reports only that a cache exists, and it holds the extraction of whichever version the management file last recorded — if the file has changed since, treat the cache as absent and take the exit-1 fallback, so the text you read is the file as it is now. **Exit 2** → the source is retracted; the guard above already dropped it, so this should not happen — leave it out if it does. **Exit 1** (no cache — a clean checkout, another machine, or a cleared cache) → fall back:

   - `type: path` → call the corresponding extraction skill per the "Prerequisite Skills (Text Extraction)" table in `../wikicommit-generate/references/text-extraction-routing.md`. If the required skill is not installed, guide the user through the install command and stop.
   - `type: url` / `type: wikicommit` → fetch it with the same fetcher `wikicommit-generate` uses, never the agent's own web-fetch tool — in Claude Code that tool returns a model-written summary of the page, and checking a page against a summary is not checking it against its source:

     ```bash
     python ../wikicommit-generate/scripts/add_source.py --fetch-url "$(cat <<'EOF'
     <source.url>
     EOF
     )" --output ".wikicommit/.cache/refetch/fix-<n>.md"
     ```

     `<n>` is the entry's position in `sources` (1, 2, …), so two URL sources on one page never share an output file. Read that file in full only after the command printed `FETCHED:`; a file left by an earlier run under the same name is not this fetch's result. **`NETWORK_UNAVAILABLE:` (exit 3)** → the request never reached the server; treat the source as not obtained and **say the reason is the environment** (no network), not the source. **`ERROR:` (exit 1)** → treat it as not obtained, like any other fetch failure below.

   Both the identifier and the URL go through quote-delimited heredocs because `sources[]` values are only format-validated. **Nothing here writes to a management file** — no `--write-hash`, no `status` change; only `wikicommit-generate` moves `source.hash`. A fetch lands under `.wikicommit/.cache/refetch/`, never in `ingest-fetch/`, so it cannot replace the cache `wikicommit-generate` compares hashes against.

5. If no source document could be obtained at all (fetch failure, `sources` is empty and there's no parent page either, or **every remaining entry was withdrawn at item 3**), warn the user and confirm whether to proceed. Since producing a fix proposal without a source raises the risk of hallucination, whether to proceed must always be the user's call. The retracted case needs no branch of its own — what is left is a fix with nothing to ground it, which is what this branch already handles — but say which of the three it was, since the answer changes what the user should do instead (for a withdrawn source, `/wikicommit-generate --regenerate` rebuilds the page from whatever sources remain, and `/wikicommit-remove` takes it down when none do).

### Step 4: Generate a Fix Proposal

**Feedback about a source, not about the page.** Before anything else, check whether a point in the feedback says that one of the documents this page was written from is itself wrong — as opposed to saying the page misreports it. The review tracking Issue asks reviewers exactly this, so on the Issue-driven route it is a comment to expect. **It is not a fix this Skill can make.** The page may be entirely faithful to the document, in which case editing the body would make it *less* faithful while leaving the document in place to be used again; and the rules below would refuse the edit anyway, since the source does not corroborate it — which is true but unhelpful, because it reports a dead end instead of naming the route. The route is a retraction: that source's management file needs `status: retracted` and a `## Retraction Reason`, **written by hand**, after which `/wikicommit-status` lists every page still standing on it and `/wikicommit-generate --regenerate` rebuilds those pages from whatever sources remain. Say that, name the source and its management file, and **do not write either value yourself** — which sources this wiki trusts is not a call this Skill makes, the same line `/wikicommit-review` draws. If the same feedback also raises points that genuinely are about the page, carry on with those below; this only takes the source-level point out of the proposal.

**Translation-page redirect check** (only when the target page identified in Step 2 has `translated_from`): before generating anything, classify **each distinct point** in the feedback identified in Step 1 (the Issue's body plus every comment, per Step 1, can raise more than one) as either **translation-specific** (a mistranslation, terminology inconsistency against the `DefinedTerm/` glossary, or unnatural/overly-literal phrasing — a property of this translation alone, not of the original page's content) or **content-derived** (a factual error, missing information, or structural issue that would equally apply to the original page). Classify per point, not the feedback as a whole — feedback often mixes both kinds (e.g. one comment asks for a phrasing fix, another flags a wrong birth year), and collapsing it into a single verdict risks sending a translation-only fix to the original page, or losing a content fix on the translation page where a future re-translation would silently discard it.

If one or more points are content-derived, ask the user once, scoped to those points: "These points may also apply to the original page (`<translated_from>`). Should the fix target the original page instead?" (fixed English — the reader here is the operator running this Skill, not the reporter Step 7 writes to) If they agree, those points' fix proposal targets the `translated_from` path instead of the translation page — Step 5's write and Step 6's report for that proposal then apply to the original page instead of the translation. Step 3's source fetch does not need to be redone for this proposal **if** the translation page's `sources` was empty when Step 3 ran (the ordinary case, since Step 3 already fell back to the parent's `sources` then, so the documents fetched are already the original page's own ground truth). If the translation page instead carried its own non-empty `sources` (uncommon, but permitted — a translation page *may* omit `sources`, it is not required to), re-run Step 3 against the `translated_from` page's own `sources` before generating this proposal, since the documents already fetched reflect the translation page's `sources`, not necessarily the parent's. Once the fix lands on the original page, the existing STALE-detection path (`source_commit` mismatch → `check_translation_status.py`) picks up the translation for re-translation on its own — this Skill does not also need to edit the translation page for these points.

If one or more points are translation-specific, their fix proposal always targets the translation page from Step 2 (never redirected), regardless of what happens with any content-derived points above.

If the user declines the redirect for the content-derived points, fold those points into the same proposal as the translation-specific ones, targeting the translation page from Step 2 unchanged — proceed exactly as if no redirect had been offered.

Pass each proposal's points, the current body of whichever page that proposal targets (per the classification above), and the source document obtained (or re-fetched, per above) into the LLM's context, and generate that proposal. When every point in the feedback classifies the same way (or the redirect is declined), this collapses to a single fix proposal.

Rules:

- Include only claims grounded in the source document. Do not add new claims absent from the source document (hallucination prevention)
- If the feedback cannot be corroborated by the source document, do not make a fix — report to the user that "the feedback could not be corroborated in the source document" (never make an ungrounded fix)
- Do not change structural frontmatter fields (`type`, `lang`, `sources`, etc.). The main focus of the fix is the body text, but if a type-specific property (nested under `properties:` — e.g. `properties.description`, `properties.birthDate`) has a clear factual error, that may also be included in the fix. When editing one, preserve the `properties:` nesting exactly as already present in the page — do not flatten it to the top level

### Step 5: User Confirmation → Write

If Step 4 produced two separate fix proposals (one redirected to the original page, one remaining on the translation page), repeat the numbered steps below once per proposal, in either order — each is its own confirmation-and-write cycle.

1. Present the fix proposal to the user in diff form (the relevant sections before/after).
2. Only after getting the user's confirmation, edit the target page. **Do not write before confirmation.**
3. If the user rejects the proposal or gives fix instructions, regenerate based on the instructions and repeat step 5.
4. **Send a rewritten page back for review**. Immediately after the edit, run:

   ```bash
   python .wikicommit/scripts/reset_review_on_content_change.py "$(cat <<'EOF'
   <target page path>
   EOF
   )"
   ```

   The free-text-in-shell-argument rule applies to the path for the same reason it applies to `<published-page-url>` in Step 2: on the Issue-driven route the path is whatever the Issue body stated, and an Issue can be opened by any reader.

   This Skill is started *because* reviewed content turned out to be wrong — and since the report link on a published page shows regardless of `review_status`, a reader reporting an error on a `reviewed` page is the designed main route here. Without this call, the reviewer's real name stays attached to the very sentences their review missed. The script compares the page against `git show HEAD:` ignoring only bookkeeping fields (`generated_at`/`generated_by`/`generated_with`, `review_status`, `reviewed_by`, `sources`), so a fix that changed the prose demotes the page to `review_status: pending` and drops `reviewed_by`; a page that was already `pending` is reported as skipped and left alone. It accepts both `.wikicommit/entity/` and `.wikicommit/view/` pages. Run it once per page written — if Step 4 produced separate proposals for the original and the translation, each cycle gets its own call.

   If the script prints `RESET:`, tell the user plainly in Step 6: this page no longer shows as reviewed, and the previous reviewer's name has been removed from it. Add that they can restore it right now with `/wikicommit-review <page>` — whoever just read this diff is in the best position to sign it, and that route writes `reviewed` locally instead of waiting for a tracking Issue to be opened and closed. Otherwise `/wikicommit-merge` will open a fresh review-tracking Issue for the page.
5. **Translator Notes**: if the target page has `translated_from` (i.e. it is a translation page) **and** the fix just written is translation-specific — a mistranslation, terminology inconsistency, or unnatural phrasing that is a property of this translation, not of the original page's content (the original does not need the same fix, since the original is correct as-is) — also append an entry to its `translator_notes` frontmatter field (a list of strings; add the field with an empty list if it doesn't exist yet). Format the entry as `"YYYY-MM-DD: <one- or two-sentence summary of what changed and why>"` using today's date, and always append (never remove or rewrite prior entries — if a new entry supersedes an older one on the same point, leave the old entry in place; the newer, later-dated entry is understood to take precedence). Write the entry in the target page's own `lang` (the translation's language, not `primary_lang` — a translator note is written for whoever next edits or re-translates this specific language variant). This exists because `/wikicommit-translate` always fully re-translates from the original page with no memory of the current translation — without this note, the fix just written would silently disappear the next time the original page changes and triggers a re-translation. Do **not** add an entry for a fix that is a genuine factual correction potentially also relevant to the original page (e.g. a wrong `properties.birthDate` value copied through from a stale source) — `translator_notes` is scoped to translation-quality issues only. Skip this step entirely for a page without `translated_from`.

### Step 6: Report Results

Briefly report to the user how the written fix (or fixes, if Step 4 produced separate proposals for the original and translation pages) addresses each point raised in the feedback (the Issue, or the free-text instruction) — and which page each point's fix was written to, so a point redirected to the original page is clearly distinguished from one that stayed on the translation page.

**If Step 3 item 3 dropped a withdrawn source, say so here**, naming it and the management file where the `## Retraction Reason` was written. The fix was grounded in the sources that remain, so this is a material fact about what the proposal did and did not rest on. Add that this Skill cannot take the entry out of the page's `sources[]` — the rules in Step 4 forbid editing structural frontmatter — and that `/wikicommit-generate --regenerate` is what drops it and rebuilds from the rest, or `/wikicommit-remove` when nothing remains.

### Guidance After Completion

```
Next steps:
- Run /wikicommit-merge to perform quality checks, PR creation, and merge
```

If the user wants to proceed all the way through PR creation automatically, you may continue on to call `wikicommit-merge` after confirming with the user, but the default is to stop at guidance only (never proceed to a PR without the user confirming the fix content).

### Step 7: Link Back to the Originating Issue

This step only applies to the **Issue-driven** route (Step 1). Page-path-driven and published-URL-driven fixes have no originating Issue to link back to — skip this step entirely for them; the fix reasoning still lands in the commit message.

If Step 4's translation-page redirect check sent a point's fix to the original page instead of the translation page the Issue nominally targeted, this step is unaffected as far as *whether or how it runs*: the `<issue-number>`/`<owner>/<repo>` this step comments on come from Step 1, not from whichever page the fix was ultimately written to. It does change what the comment must say, though: if any point was redirected, the `<one-line summary of the fix>` below must say so explicitly (name the original page path, and note that the translation page itself is unchanged until a future re-translation picks up the fix) — otherwise the reporter, who filed feedback against the translation page's tracking Issue, would reasonably read "merged" and assume the translation page itself was directly corrected.

For the Issue-driven route, this step only applies once `wikicommit-merge` has actually run to completion and reported a successful merge (its Step 7 confirmed the merge completed, and its Step 10 completion report gives the bulk-update PR number) — whether that happened as a direct continuation of this same conversation or because the user (or you, resumed with this conversation's context) ran `/wikicommit-merge` separately afterward. If `wikicommit-merge` was never run, or it aborted, or its PR was closed without merging, skip this step entirely — do not comment.

Comment on the originating Issue (`<issue-number>`/`<owner>/<repo>` from Step 1) to close the loop with the reporter:

```bash
gh issue comment <issue-number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
We looked into what you reported and merged the fix in PR #<bulk-update PR number> (<one-line summary of the fix>).

If it looks right to you, please close this Issue yourself.
EOF
)"
```

**Render this comment in the `lang` of the target page identified in Step 2** — the page the reporter actually read. Read that page's `lang` frontmatter field, which `validate_frontmatter.py` requires every page to carry. When it is `en`, emit the English text above verbatim. If the page's `lang` cannot be read at all (missing field, unparseable frontmatter), fall back to `translation.primary_lang` from `.wikicommit/config.yml`, and to English when that too is `en`, missing, or unreadable — a defensive chain only, since `lang` is a required field.

**When the Issue was filed through a published page's report link, its body names the page's language outright — use that in preference to the Step 2 page.** The banner prefills the body with a `Page:` line (the published URL of the page that was open) and a `Language:` line carrying that page's `lang`, both outside the HTML comment. Neither is a judgement call: the banner wrote them from the very page the reporter was reading. This matters because **Step 2 does not resolve that page on this route**. The prefill states a published URL, not a `.wikicommit/entity/` path, so Step 2 skips its first branch and falls through to a keyword search — and that search merges a page with its translations into one row (`translated_from`, `(also in: <lang>)`), collapsing exactly the distinction this rule turns on. On a `primary_lang: ja` wiki with `targets: [en]`, an English reporter's Issue can therefore resolve to the `ja` original and get a Japanese reply, which is the failure this rule exists to prevent. So: if the body carries a language line, render in that value; otherwise, if it carries a page URL, resolve it with Step 2's published-URL script and use the resulting page's `lang`; otherwise use the Step 2 page's `lang` as above. **Match both labels in either of the banner's two locales** — `Language:` / `言語:` and `Page:` / `ページ:`. The labels themselves render in the page's own locale, so a report filed from a `ja` page carries `言語: ja`, and matching only the English spelling would miss it and fall through to the search this rule exists to bypass — mirroring the same failure onto a `primary_lang: en` wiki with `targets: [ja]`. The set is bounded and does not need guessing at: the banner ships exactly two locales, and a page in any third language renders it in English, so those four spellings cover every page. Whichever page the *fix* was written to is unaffected — this chain only picks the language.

The language follows the reader, and this reader is the person who filed the report — by design that includes someone who only reads the published wiki and has no Claude Code session at all. It matters more here than almost anywhere else, because this Skill deliberately does not run `gh issue close`: if the reporter cannot read this comment, they do not know the loop is theirs to close, and the Issue stays open.

**The page's `lang`, not `primary_lang`.** The one thing WikiCommit does know about the reporter is that they read this page, and a page's banner and report link render in that page's own `lang` — so the language they read it in is the page's, not the wiki's. The two values only differ on a wiki with `targets`: on a `primary_lang: ja` wiki with `targets: [en]`, `primary_lang` sends an English reader a Japanese reply about an Issue only they can close.

**Step 4's redirect does not change this.** When a content-derived point was redirected to the `translated_from` page, the fix was *written* to a page whose `lang` differs from the one that was *read* — and it is the reading that decides the language here. Use the Step 2 page's `lang` in that case too. This is also the case where it matters most: the comment must then say that the original page was corrected and this translation is unchanged until a future re-translation (see above), which is precisely the part the reporter has to be able to read.

**Do not copy the tracking-Issue bodies' choice of `primary_lang`.** A tracking Issue is closed by whoever holds write access — a property of the repository — whereas here there is one reporter per page, and the page is what they read; the same rule ("the language follows the reader") gives different answers because the readers differ. (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/report.md` stays English because there is one per repository.)

**This agrees with Step 5's item 5** (`translator_notes`), which also writes in the target page's own `lang` — both are attached to that one language variant.

**Do not infer the language from the report's own text.** What the reporter wrote is direct evidence of a language they read, and stronger than any inference from the page — but judging it is not deterministic (a short report, or one that is a proper noun and a URL, carries no signal), and it would make the language of a machine-emitted comment depend on a judgement call where a deterministic answer now exists. Use the page's `lang` even when the report is plainly written in something else. **This bars reading the reporter's own prose, not the banner's `Language:` line** (above) — that line is machine-emitted from the page they had open, so taking it is not an inference at all.

Leave untranslated the things anyone is expected to type or match on: the PR reference (`PR #<number>`), command names, file paths, and frontmatter keys and values.

Do not run `gh issue close`. Landing the fix on `main` does not by itself confirm the reporter is satisfied with the result, so closing the Issue is left to the reporter's judgement — the comment above only asks them to do so once they're happy.

Only comment after the merge is confirmed, never before. Commenting (or closing) as soon as the fix is written in Step 5 — before `wikicommit-merge`'s quality gates and merge have actually succeeded — would leave a stale, misleading comment on the Issue if the PR later gets blocked by a `check_wikilinks.py`/`validate_frontmatter.py` error, fails to auto-merge, or times out during Step 7's polling.

## Notes

- Never write to a page without user confirmation (step 5)
- Do not commit or create a PR against `main` or any branch (that is `wikicommit-merge`'s responsibility)
- Do not add claims that don't exist in the source document (hallucination)
- Do not write to `.wikicommit/schema/` (read-only)
- Never close the originating Issue yourself (step 7) — comment only, and let the reporter close it
