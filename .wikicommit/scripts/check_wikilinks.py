"""Check WikiLinks in wiki pages for broken or removed references.

Usage:
    python .wikicommit/scripts/check_wikilinks.py [--changed <path>... [--deleted <path>...]]

With no arguments, every page under .wikicommit/entity/ is checked, matching
validate_frontmatter.py, check_raw_html.py and check_orphans.py. It used to
print "OK: 0 files checked" and exit 0 instead — output a reader cannot tell
from a clean run of a real check (Issue #571). wikicommit-merge always passes
--changed, so the diff-scoped behaviour it relies on is unaffected.

Exit code: 0 = no ERROR (WARNINGs OK), 1 = at least one ERROR.
