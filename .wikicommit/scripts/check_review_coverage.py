"""check_review_coverage.py — read the review records back (Issue #750).

`record_review.py` writes one immutable file per review under
`.wikicommit/review/`. This is the consumer that makes that tree worth having:
without it the records would be a receptacle with nothing reading it, which is
the shape Issue #553 rules out.

It answers four questions a wiki cannot otherwise ask:

- **How much of the wiki has actually been reviewed, and by what?**
  `SUMMARY:` and `COVERAGE:`. The point is the *denominator*. The Completion
  Notice reports failures, so a reader sees "3 findings" with no way to know
  whether that is out of 3 pages or 300; and reporting per model is what makes
  it possible to notice later that one model finds a certain defect and
  another does not.
- **What has nothing standing behind it?** `UNREVIEWED:` — no record judges the
  page as it now stands. Almost always that means no record at all; it also
  covers a page whose every record was `result: discarded`, which judged a draft
  that was thrown away and therefore says nothing about the text on disk
  (Issue #766). Those two are one list rather than two because they call for the
  same thing — someone has to look at this page — and the line says which of the
  two it is, so nothing is hidden by putting them together.
- **What is most worth a human reading?** `RISKY:` — a page whose *standing*
  review took more than one attempt, or raised findings. This is the sampling
  blueprint, and it is exactly what evaporated when the verdict was discarded.
  "Standing" means the newest record that judged the page as it now stands, of
  either kind; the list therefore shrinks when a later review comes back clean,
  rather than accumulating every page that ever had a bad day (Issue #760).
- **Which verdicts no longer apply?** `STALE_REVIEW:`, in both of the two ways
  a verdict can go stale: the page's own text changed after the review, or the
  evidence under it did.

The second staleness case is the one nothing else covers. A `/wikicommit-fix`
edit sends `review_status` back to `pending` (Issue #724) so the *human* side
self-corrects, but the machine's verdict was made against text that no longer
exists and, before this tree, nothing recorded that it had been made at all.

`STALE_REVIEW:` does not become noise, and that follows from the structure
rather than from a threshold: Pass 4 re-runs on every regeneration, so the
only ways a verdict outlives its page are a `/wikicommit-fix` edit and a source
that changed underneath it.

## Which records each line reads

Every per-page line and every count reads the *standing* record: the newest one
that actually judged the page as it now stands. Only the kind it has to be
differs:

- `SUMMARY: ai_reviewed` / `COVERAGE:` — the standing **AI** record, so a model
  is credited with its latest surviving verdict for a page rather than with
  every verdict it ever wrote for it.
- `SUMMARY: human_reviewed` — the standing **human** record.
- `SUMMARY: human_notes` — how many of those left a prose note (Issue #952).
  It counts **presence, not content**: a one-word note and a paragraph are both
  one, so this measures whether the ask reached anyone, not whether the page was
  read. Closing with no comment is a legitimate way to close (Issue #762) and is
  not reported as a defect anywhere — this number is the only place the
  difference shows at all.
- `UNREVIEWED:` — printed when there is no standing record of either kind.
- `RISKY:` — the standing record of **any** kind (Issue #760).
- `STALE_REVIEW:` / `RETRACTED_EVIDENCE:` — the standing **AI** record
  (`standing_verdict()`), because staleness is measured against the machine's
  evidence list.

That single definition is the whole of Issue #766. Before it, the counts and
`UNREVIEWED:` used a different rule from the three per-page verdict lines: they
read the newest AI record whether or not it had judged anything, and treated
"has a record" as "has been reviewed". A page whose only records were
`result: discarded` therefore appeared in **no** per-page line at all while
`SUMMARY:` and `COVERAGE:` counted it as reviewed — `COVERAGE:` could report a
page with `attempts>=2` that `RISKY:` stayed silent about, and a model could be
credited with covering a page it never successfully judged. That is not a
contrived state: Pass 4 records a discarded review for an `action: update`
entity that exhausts `max_retries`, and a page generated before this tree
existed has no earlier record to fall back on.

Discarded attempts are still visible, in two places rather than folded into a
number that overstates coverage. Each `COVERAGE:` line carries its own count of
the pages whose **newest AI record** is a discarded one that model wrote — which
is what makes a quiet `RISKY:` legible instead of contradictory — and
`SUMMARY: findings=` still totals their findings.

That column is keyed on the page's newest AI record rather than on each model's
own newest, and deliberately so: it exists to explain a `RISKY:` line that is
missing, and once *any* later review has judged the current text there is no
missing line left to explain. A model whose discarded attempt was superseded by
another model's verdict therefore gets no count here.

`SUMMARY: findings=` is the deliberate exception to the standing rule: it is a
running tally of how much reviewing has caught over the wiki's life, which is a
historical quantity and correctly cumulative, so it counts discarded reviews
too (Issue #760, reaffirmed as out of scope by Issue #766).

## No thresholds, no automation

Nothing here decides anything. There is no pass mark, no percentage a wiki has
to reach, and no action taken. A human reads `RISKY:` and `COVERAGE:` and
decides whether to read a page or run `/wikicommit-generate --regenerate`
(Issue #578); that closes the loop by hand, which is the right place for it
until there is real data to set a threshold from. A number invented before the
measurement exists is a guess wearing a decimal point.

## Orphaned records are deliberately not reported

Records outlive their pages by design, so a deleted page leaves a directory
behind. Whether that is worth reporting is a question to answer once real
repositories have accumulated some — reporting it now would add a line to
every run in exchange for nothing anyone has asked for (Issue #750 検討事項 3).

Usage:
    python .wikicommit/scripts/check_review_coverage.py
    python .wikicommit/scripts/check_review_coverage.py --discarded-reason <page>...

The second form answers one narrow question for `/wikicommit-merge` Step 9 —
why a page in `failed_pages` was thrown away — and reports nothing else.

Exit code: always 0 (informational, non-blocking).
