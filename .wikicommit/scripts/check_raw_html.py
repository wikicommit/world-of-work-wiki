"""Detect raw HTML tags in wiki page body content.

WikiCommit's design commits to embedding local/external images, video files,
and YouTube via standard Markdown image syntax only (`![alt](path-or-url)`,
which Quartz handles natively) — there is no legitimate
need for a wiki page body to contain a raw HTML tag. Quartz's Markdown-to-
HTML pipeline passes raw HTML straight through regardless of
`enableInHtmlEmbed` (`remarkRehype(..., { allowDangerousHtml: true })` is
always on in Quartz core), so an unreviewed page (`review_status: pending`)
that picks up a `<script>`/`<iframe>` tag — whether from an indirect prompt
injection in an ingested source document, or an LLM hallucination — would
execute in a reader's browser as soon as it is auto-merged and published,
before any human reviews it (Issue #377). This script is the merge-time
blocking gate that closes that gap: any raw HTML tag found in page body
content is a blocking ERROR, with no tag allowlist (the design position is
"no raw HTML at all", not "no dangerous HTML" — see the module-level
docstring's "known limitation" note below for what this trades away).

Content inside fenced code blocks (``` / ~~~) and inline code spans (`...`)
is excluded from detection, since Markdown renders that content as escaped
text (not a raw-HTML AST node) regardless of `allowDangerousHtml` — a HowTo
page that shows `<script>` as a code example poses no rendering risk and is
not disallowed.

CommonMark autolinks (`<https://example.com>`, `<user@example.com>`) are not
flagged — they are Pass 3's documented technique for disambiguating a bare
URL from surrounding prose (`.claude/skills/wikicommit-generate/SKILL.md`
Pass 3 step 8), not raw HTML. They are naturally excluded because an HTML
tag name in this script's pattern cannot be followed by `:` or `@`.

Known limitation: a purely inert tag with no scripting capability (e.g.
`<br>` for a line break inside a table cell) is blocked the same as
`<script>`, since this script intentionally has no tag allowlist to
maintain (an allowlist is exactly the sanitize-list design this Issue chose
not to build, once the embed styleguide in CLAUDE.md established that no
raw HTML tag has a legitimate use in a wiki page body). A false positive on
`a<b>c` style inequality chains outside of code fences is possible for the
same reason; this is treated as an acceptable trade-off for a blocking
security gate that fails safe.

Usage:
    python .wikicommit/scripts/check_raw_html.py               # all files
    python .wikicommit/scripts/check_raw_html.py <path>...     # specific files

Exit code: 0 = no ERROR, 1 = at least one ERROR.
