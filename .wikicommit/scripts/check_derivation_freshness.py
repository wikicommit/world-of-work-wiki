"""Detect stale synthesized pages whose derivation sources have been updated.

wikicommit-synthesize pages record their multiple source pages in
`derived_from` (a list of {path, source_commit} entries — the multi-source
analog of translated_from/source_commit). This compares each entry's
source_commit against that source page's current HEAD commit. Reports
STALE when they differ, and MISSING_SOURCE when the source page no longer
exists. A page with multiple stale/missing entries gets one line per entry
(same aggregation pattern as check_expires.py etc. — duplicate `page:`
lines for the same page are expected).

Usage:
    python .wikicommit/scripts/check_derivation_freshness.py

Exit code: always 0 (warning-only, non-blocking).
